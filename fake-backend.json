            "body_html": "<p>Drexel Men’s Soccer ‘22 alum Chris Donovan will continue to represent the program and Philadelphia at the professional level, as it was recently announced that he has signed a contract extension with Major League Soccer team the Philadelphia Union – extending until 2025, with additional options for 2026 and 2027.</p>\n<p>A graduate of Conestoga High School just outside of Philadelphia, Donovan spoke with The Triangle on what it means to continue to play for his home team and to know that he will continue representing Philadelphia at the highest professional level of US Soccer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Everything worked out really perfectly for me to end up here.” Donovan shared, “It was really unlikely that that’s how it was going to work out, but that’s how it happened, and I couldn’t be happier.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During his time with the Drexel Dragons, Donovan made 60 appearances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was a slow start, and then we had a change of coaching staff, and we really came alive after the COVID break,” Donovan recalled. “It was a solid group of guys that we had… during my final season, the class above mine and my class were hitting our peak.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A forward, Donovan scored a whopping 30 goals while on the Drexel team, 12 of which came in his 2021 season– a senior year resulting in receipt of Drexel’s John Semanik Award awarded to the top male all-around student athlete. As a result of his Drexel career, Donovan was drafted to the MLS’s Columbus Crew, before signing with the Philadelphia Union II team for the 2022 season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I had won some awards and my coach really wanted me to stay, but he ultimately left it up to me, so I decided to go to Columbus when they drafted me,” Donovan explained. “It didn’t work out there, and it all worked out for the best.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After less than six months with the Union II, Donovan signed with the first team on June 17, 2022, making his debut appearance just a day later on June 18, 2022 against FC Cincinnati. Drexel Men’s Soccer Assistant Coach Flo Liu, who himself played at UConn with Union goalkeeper (and record three-time MLS Goalkeeper of the Year) Andre Blake, shared what it means to the program to have Donovan as a representative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“To have a local ambassador like Chris Donovan is fantastic for Drexel,” Liu explained, “I always get asked the question by recruits that I speak to: ‘who are some of the pros that you have?’ and I always tell them the same thing, which is that we have Chris Donovan, who is with the Union first team.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Donovan’s time with the Union comes at a crucial point in MLS history, as the league has been gaining significant international and domestic popularity over the last couple of years, most notoriously after Inter Miami’s signing of legendary Argentine player Lionel Messi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The league is becoming more and more attractive,” Liu summated, “It’s a league that’s gaining a lot of attention for the right reasons. Attendance, salary, and just the atmosphere of being in the US… I think that the league is growing a lot. Chris Donovan being a part of that is very, very exciting.”</p>\n<p>The Union’s semifinal match against Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup – the team’s first game against Inter Miami after the acquisition of Messi – was made possible by what Donovan considers as his biggest moment so far as a part of the Union: his goal in the last minute of extra time in the Leagues Cup quarterfinal match against Mexican club Querétaro F.C., which allowed the Union a 2-1 victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We pretty much knew who we were playing if we won, and then to score as the clock hit 100 minutes – I couldn’t put it into words how awesome that was,” Donovan recounted, “the VAR wait [after] for about two minutes standing in midfield was the longest two minutes of all time.”</p>\n<p>Donovan then went on to start in the Philadelphia-Miami faceoff in the Leagues Cup Semi Final.</p>\n<p>“Handshake with Messi before the game–I definitely saved the picture of that,” said Donovan. But Messi is not the only big name to join Inter Miami as of late. “It’s going to be really, really cool to play against them again. Luis Suarez is actually one of my idols, personally, because I’m a Liverpool fan,” Donovan explained. “I’d really like to play against him, and maybe get his jersey after the game.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A good representation of the recent MLS gains in international traction is Donovan’s own contract announcement, which was shared by famed Italian sports journalist Fabrizio Romano. On Dec. 16, 2023, Romano posted the news to his over 19.7M followers on X (formerly known as Twitter).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was definitely really cool… I just never thought it would happen. My agent told me after getting the deal done that he was going to try to get Fabrizio Romano to tweet it,” said Donovan. “It was a little bit of time that passed – like two weeks since I had actually signed it – so I wasn’t even still thinking about it… But, then he did, and that made it even more of a surprise, really, so it was very cool.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Donovan values his Drexel education – a degree in Sports Management could help shape his future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I do imagine that it will help me when I try to go into a coaching career afterwards,” Donovan explained. “I’ve already done coaching in the past and a little recently in the present, but there's not enough time now obviously with playing all the time. That’s what I’d like to do in the future.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liu characterizes Donovan’s impact on the Drexel and Philadelphia communities perfectly, noting, “He’s a Philly Pride, but obviously a Drexel Pride as well.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for Donovan’s thoughts on continuing to represent Philadelphia, his statement was clear: “I was very willing to sign a contract extension because I wanted to stay here.”</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>After an incredibly disappointing finish to the 2023 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles have completely overhauled their coaching staff in an attempt to build towards 2024.</p>\n<p>After starting 10-1 and looking like the Super Bowl contenders everyone envisioned, the Eagles &nbsp;went 1-5 to finish the season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the 9-8 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>\n<p>Questions arose about the status of head coach Nick Sirianni, offensive coordinator Brian Johnson, and new defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. Many expected all three to be let go, for various reasons. Sirianni, the head coach, is the first to blame when a collapse of this magnitude occurs. Johnson, the offensive play caller, oversaw a struggling offense, even though it was loaded with stars and playmakers. And Patricia, the defensive play caller, took over for former defensive coordinator Sean Desai in December and the defense played significantly worse because of it.</p>\n<p>The first to go were both defensive coordinators from this past season, Patricia and Desai. Desai was fired and Patricia, who was only under contract for one season, was not asked to extend his contract.</p>\n<p>The Eagles then swiftly hired accomplished coach Vic Fangio to lead the defense. Fangio previously helped the Eagles in an advisory capacity andd served as the Miami Dolphins’ defensive coordinator for this season. But when they had a vacancy at the coordinator position this offseason, Fangio requested to leave the Miami Dolphins and join the Eagles. He should help lead a group that is much better than what was shown on the field this year.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, the Eagles decided to fire Brian Johnson, who took over as offensive coordinator this season after former OC Shane Steichen took a head coaching job with the Indianapolis Colts. Johnson rose all the way up to offensive coordinator after joining as a QB coach, and there were high hopes for his play calling abilities. Those did not come into fruition and the offense took a major step back this year.</p>\n<p>The Eagles ended up making a splash hire, getting former Cowboys and Chargers OC Kellen Moore to take on the same role in Philadelphia. Moore is a rising star in the coaching field and many have declared him a future head coach. He will look to add more motion and different route trees to this Eagles offense that, with the right scheme, should be elite next season.</p>\n<p>The elephant in the room is the return of Sirianni. Many believe he should have been let go after such a big breakdown this season, but owner Jeffery Lurie and GM Howie Rosmean decided to have him return and hire a whole new staff.</p>\n<p>It is yet to be seen how this new coaching staff will fare with this Eagles roster, but there is no doubt these changes were needed. The team had too much talent to not win even a single playoff game, and the hope is a fresh set of voices in the locker room can help lead the charge for a more successful 2024 season.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Philadelphia Eagles headed into their Week 13 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers with a 10-1 record, with their only loss coming in Week 6 against the New York Jets. Within five weeks, their victories against Miami, Dallas, Kansas City, and Buffalo showed how potentially dangerous the Eagles were against top-ranked opponents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head Coach Nick Sirriani was one of the key factors in their success. They were top of the NFC conference and had the chance to repeat as the number one seed. The Eagles' signature move, the ‘Tush Push,’ was unstoppable as Jalen Hurts broke the rushing touchdown record by a quarterback. Their dominance echoed their form from last season, where they made a charge to a Super Bowl appearance. Yet the matchup against the 49ers and the matchups that followed showed how different the Eagles were compared to last year.</p>\n<p>The 49ers returned to Lincoln Financial Field for a rematch of last season’s NFC Championship, in which they lost both of their quarterbacks in a 31-7 loss. Despite the Eagles taking a 6-0 lead in the opening quarter, the 49ers began to take control of the match. Deebo Samuel had 138 total yards and 3 total touchdowns on their way to a 42–19 rout of the Eagles&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following week against the Dallas Cowboys was just as poor as against San Francisco. The Eagles had beaten Dallas at home earlier in the season, but the Dallas offense was dominant throughout the second matchup. Dak Prescott threw for 271 yards and two touchdowns while the Eagles did not score an offensive touchdown. A Jalen Carter fumble recovery touchdown was the lone instance where the Eagles saw the end zone. The Eagles lost 33-13 and fell to a 10-3 record, the same as the Cowboys. This loss also meant that they lost the #1 seed to San Francisco as they broke the head-to-head tiebreaker.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their Week 15 matchup saw them enter Seattle to face the then 7-7 Seahawks. The Eagles were now in the midst of the NFC title with San Francisco and Dallas in the hunt, but a victory at Lumen Field would help ease the nerves of the Philadelphia faithful. Heading into the fourth quarter the Eagles led by ten points thanks to two Jalen Hurts rushing touchdowns and a Jake Elliott field goal. However, Seattle’s defense was able to hold the Eagles scoreless in the final quarter. With less than a minute remaining, the Seahawks backup quarterback threw a 29-yard pass to rookie wide receiver Jaxson Smith-Njigba for the game-winning touchdown. Seattle upset the Eagles 20-17.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Questions began to arise within the Eagles head coaching staff and players. Offensive coordinator Brian Johnson was unable to achieve the offensive efficiency that previous coordinator Shane Steichen did the previous year. Defensive coordinator Sean Desai also underperformed with a pass defense, that ranked as one of the best last year. Though Matt Patricia replaced Desai in mid-December, the birds still faced devastating losses. Additionally, Eagles cornerback James &nbsp;Bradberry received a lot of flack for allowing every successful pass in Seattle’s game-winning drive, including the pass to Smith-Njigba.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Eagles’ Week 16 matchup saw the 4-10 New York Giants in a divisional showdown. Touchdowns from Jalen Hurts, D'Andre Swift, and DeVonta Smith helped the Eagles score 33 points on the Giants. However, New York was able to stay within arm's length of Philadelphia. The Giants scored touchdowns through running back Saquon Barkley, quarterback Tyrod Taylor, and a defensive 76-yard pick-six from Adoree Jackson. With the Giants down by one possession late in the fourth, a desperation heave by Tyrod Taylor was met by Eagles rookie cornerback Kelee Ringo to intercept the pass and give the Eagles a 33-25 victory. They improve to 11-4.</p>\n<p>After returning to their winning ways in Week 16 against the New York Giants, the Eagles welcomed the Arizona Cardinals to Lincoln Financial Field for the penultimate match of the season. The Eagles were still in the hunt for the NFC East as a result of back-to-back losses for the Dallas Cowboys. The first half saw the Eagles dominate, with their defense holding Arizona to just six points and their offense two touchdowns. Jalen Hurts found Julio Jones twice in the endzone and rookie cornerback Sydney Brown intercepted Kyler Murray’s pass and returned it for a 99-yard pick-six.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The third quarter was all Cardinals as Kyler Murray threw two touchdown passes to level the match 21-21. Early in the fourth, Hurts found tight-end Dallas Goedert to take the lead again, but the Cardinals answered with a touchdown of their own and leveled the game again, With less than two and a half minutes remaining, Jake Elliott’s successful field goal gave the Eagles a narrow 31-28 lead. However, their defense was unable to fend off Arizona’s rushing offense, as running back James Conner punched in the game-winning touchdown to hand Philadelphia their fourth loss in five weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Eagles flew up to North Jersey to face the Giants for the second time in two weeks. Despite their losses, the Eagles were still able to win the division with a win against the Giants and a Dallas loss to the Washington Commanders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Giants maintained complete control over Philadelphia as they went into halftime up 24-0. Coach Sirriani decided to pull all of the starters for the second half and begin to prepare for the playoffs. The Giants won 27-10 as the Eagles finished the regular season with an 11-6 record. They are only the second team in the NFL to finish with 7 losses after starting 10-1.</p>\n<p>With the Cowboys clinching the NFC East, The Eagles clinched the first wildcard spot to set up a matchup with the NFC South Champions: The 9-8 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The game started with Tampa Bay receiving the opening kickoff. Coach Sirianni has often talked about how important it is to get off to fast starts so the team doesn’t have to play from behind, and this time it was up to the defense to get the game started on a good note. They failed to do so, letting Tampa Bay drive down the field and kick a field goal. This was not the way Sirianni and the Eagles wanted to open up the game.</p>\n<p>Down 3-0, Hurts and the offense took the field. If they could march down and score a touchdown, there would be hope that this offense could carry the team to a victory. They instead got just 19 yards through 5 plays and were forced to punt.</p>\n<p>On the very next drive, Tampa Bay drove 79 yards in 4 plays and took a 10-0 lead. Poor tackling was a theme throughout the game and was very prominent on the first touchdown of the game.</p>\n<p>With 5:35 remaining in the second quarter, with the Eagles down 16-3. They finally were able to get the offense going, with Hurts finding DeVonta Smith for a 54-yard completion followed by a Dallas Goedert red zone TD to bring them within one score. And then everything fell apart. As the Eagles kicked the extra point, Tampa Bay was offside, allowing the Eagles to move a would-be two-point conversion from 2 yards out to 1 yard, which calls for the patented ‘Tush Push,’ one of the most successful plays in NFL history. The Eagles tried, and failed, and that was the beginning of the end. Down 16-9 going into halftime, Tampa Bay would go on to outscore them 16-0 in the second half, making for a brutal 32-9 loss and the end of the Eagles season, one that looked so promising just weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Watching tape from the Eagles' week three victory against Tampa Bay shows just how far this team has fallen. In that game, they dominated on both sides of the ball and came out with a 25-11 win. The team that showed up in the wildcard round, however, is a far cry from what it once was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a football team as strong as the Philadelphia Eagles, they demonstrated their dominance with a 10-1 record over the first twelve weeks. Yet the San Francisco loss led to a snowball effect of multiple losses which saw them finish the season with a 1-6 record over the final seven games. To make things worse, legendary, fan-favorite, All-Pro center Jason Kelce announced his retirement after thirteen seasons with Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what went wrong with the Philadelphia Eagles? Usually during the offseason a team would address the changes that need to be made and make the adjustments to improve the team. Whether by signing a free agent, trading for an established player, or through the NFL Draft, there are multiple ways to bolster a football team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eagles offensive coordinator Brian Johnson was unable to efficiently utilize a star lineup that was the -third-highest-scoring offense last season. Their Pro Bowl-studded offensive line with the likes of Jason Kelce, Lane Johnson and Landon Dickerson gave Jalen Hurts enough time and space in the pocket. Hurts’ receivers, the likes of All-Pro A.J Brown, Heisman award winner DeVonta Smith, and tight-end Dallas Goedert, have all had a decent season, with Brown and Smith having 1,000+ receiving yards. Yet Brian Johnson’s mundane and predictable tactics prevented the Eagles from having the success they had last year under Shane Steichen.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, defensive coordinator Sean Desai has had a difficult time managing an Eagles defense that soared the previous year and ranked 8th best under Johnathon Gannon. Four Eagles had double-digit sacks as they combined for 70 total, the third most in NFL league history. However, this year it was their secondary that caused them to finish third-to-last in points allowed. They were unable to cover their opponents man to man, and when they played zone defense, they allowed their opponents to find the open holes and run for a huge gain. Key factors for their struggling defense included injuries, aging players, and young rookies who hadn’t had much experience. The only bright spots in this defense are linebacker Haason Redick having another double-digit sack season and Jalen Carter having a Defensive Rookie of the Year caliber season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Eagles desperately need to make changes if they want to make it back to the Super Bowl. With contracts soon to expire, players aging out of their prime and the teams around them improving, their window of opportunity is slowly getting smaller. Do they make adjustments to the coordinator position? Do they part ways with players to make way for new ones? One player they will have to part ways with is star center Jason Kelce, who embodied the team as well as the spirit of the season. Are the Eagles as good as people say they are? Are they still one of the elite teams of the NFL? These questions all need answers before they kick off Week 1 next season.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Jan. 26 marks the four-year anniversary of the death of Philly-born NBA legend Kobe Bryant. It was this past Friday four years ago that Kobe and his daughter Gianna were among nine people who lost their lives in a tragic helicopter accident.</p>\n<p>In memoriam of the anniversary of their death, we have looked into the life Kobe led here in Philadelphia, as well as the love the city held for him. Bryant was born Aug. 23, 1978, in Philadelphia where his father Joe “Jellybean” Bryant spent the first four years of his basketball career as a 76er (from 1975-1979). At six years old, Kobe's family moved to Italy where his dad played for several teams.</p>\n<p>Several years later, Kobe returned to Philly and attended Lower Merion Highschool in Ardmore, where he played from 1992-1996. Although he quickly became a starter for the Aces upon arriving in Lower Merion, it took some time for the team to get on its feet as they ended 4-20 Bryant’s first season. But Bryant and the Aces would hold a 77- 13 record in his next three years on the team. His junior year, Bryant dominated the high school basketball scene. It was in this season that he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game, according to Penn Live.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He ended the year being named Pennsylvania Player of the Year. His senior year, Bryant averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots per game. The start of the season, the Aces were 1-3, but won 30 straight games from there and ended the 1995-96 season with a record of 31-3. Since 1943, the Lower Merion Aces had not won a state championship. That all changed in Bryant’s 1996 senior season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On March 23, 1996, a crowd of thousands gathered in front of Hersheypark Arena while hundreds more watched the game on television to see Lower Merion go head-to-head with Erie Cathedral Prep. The Aces took the PIAA Class 4A title game with a score of 48-43, with Bryant scoring 17 of the game’s points. His senior year, Bryant was named the Naismith High School Player of the Year, the Gatorade Men’s National Basketball Player of the Year, a USA Today All-USA First Team player, and a McDonald’s All-American. He left high school basketball with a state record of 2,883 points, five championships and one regular-season MVP award. In 2002, Lower Merion retired Bryant’s #33 jersey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2010, Bryant donated $411,000 to Lower Merion, and the school rebuilt the gym and named it in the beloved alum’s honor – The Kobe Bryant Gymnasium. Despite offers from top colleges including schools such as Villanova and Duke, Bryant decided to go straight to the NBA after high school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the 1996 NBA draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Bryant with the 13th overall pick. They then traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for center Vlade Divac. As he never left the Lakers throughout his entire 20-year career, Bryant developed a complicated relationship with his hometown Philadelphia. Bryant and the Lakers defeated Iverson and the 76ers 4-1 in the 2001 NBA Finals and, after winning the All-Star Game MVP in 2002, Bryant was booed loudly by the Philly crowd. However, in his last game in Philadelphia on Dec. 1, 2015, fans gave Kobe a standing ovation while proudly chanting his name.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On January 26, 2020, Bryant and his daughter Gianna, along with seven others, including 14-year-old Alyssa Altobelli and 13-year-old Payton Chester, died in a helicopter accident in the Calabasas area northwest of Los Angeles. Philadelphia mourned the loss of the local legend. Nearly a week after his death, Bryant was honored at his former high school where around 1,600 people, including former high school teammates, showed up for the tribute in the Kobe Bryant Gymnasium. A memorial was built in front of Lower Merion where mourners left basketballs, flowers, letters, and jerseys.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Ben Franklin Bridge, Center City, Boathouse Row, and the Wells Fargo Center, and countless other places shone brightly with purple lights in the week following Bryant's death. A basketball court at the Tustin Playground in Philadelphia’s Overbrook neighborhood was established to pay tribute to Kobe and his daughter Gianna. It was completed with a beautiful mural of the father and daughter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant may have won five NBA championships, two Olympic gold medals, eighteen All-Star selections, and four All-Star Game MVP awards as well as held countless other achievements with the Los Angeles Lakers, but in Philadelphia he will always been known as the local legend and high school basketball prodigy.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Maybe I am extra cagey because this is my final winter term as a Drexel student – or I am fully projecting my insecurities about the future onto this inanimate winter landscape - but it feels like I am extra sensitive to the inconveniences being thrown at me by this volatile season. I bemoan how 35th street – the one I always take from my house to get to campus – never seems salted, but maybe this was always the case. A few students in my class at Lincoln Center cite slipping upwards of five times on the way there, and I’m proud to say that makes me feel a little less crazy.</p>\n<p>One difficulty I encounter with classes in the winter is the temperature inside the classrooms, which for some reason seems consistently impossible to augment. Heading to class in twenty degree weather, I find it crucial to pack on a few layers. But then with almost every class I go to, the temperature is always turned way up, so I quickly go from a feeling of relief from being out in the cold into a very sticky, sweaty panic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As daunting and dread-inducing as the winter walks can be, I actually find it more distressing when class is put online due to inclement weather. A sentiment I have heard reflected by a lot of my close friends and classmates is that if it’s between an irksome walk and being trapped in their apartment for three hours tuning into an online class, they would actually choose the irksome walk. Most people I know admittedly go on their phones or have other tabs open when there’s a class running for three hours with little to no breaks, and I don’t blame them. Others find themselves distracted by the property or pets in their living space, or end up cooking a meal. I think when the decision is made to put an in-person class online it transports us back to the time of quarantine, which is immediately jarring and suffocating. When I am confronted with the winter weather, I am always grateful for any obligation – whether it be a job or class – to move around and be somewhere other than my apartment, because if it were up to me (against my best interest as it may be), I would not leave all that much. Thus, having to go to class in person ends up being very good for my soul.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reflecting on all this, I have found that – as backwards as it may sound – the more cold it is, the more rewarding it can feel to leave your house. Even if the extent of my physical activity is trudging my way to the Septa so I can get to the mall and watch a movie, that feels better to me than if I’d stayed inside. I &nbsp;have also found in my recent experience that the same has applied in the gym. My modus operandi is to go to the gym for a few months, and then halt that process entirely for about six months to a year. Lately I am trying to set more practical goals, and I have found that even if I go to the gym a few times a week, the notoriously hard to handle winter term course load feels just a little bit less intimidating in my head. Going to the gym feels good as it is, even if all you do is go on the treadmill for fifteen minutes. To me, that feeling is doubly enhanced by going to the gym in the winter, because it helps you prove to yourself that you’re at least attempting to stay sane. I guess that what I am getting at is that in the winter, when our seasonal depression is doing push ups, it’s extra important to do things that make us feel just a little bit better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lately, I have also found the winter term invaluable for making peace with yourself and your feelings, just getting centered overall. The most beneficial method I have found for that is journaling. I am a writer, in case you couldn’t tell, but you don’t have to be one to practice journaling. I have found that when you write down your fears and anxieties on paper – whether it be broad anxieties about the term, specific projects you’re doubting your ability to tackle, or a packed schedule you’re not sure how to navigate – those things inevitably become easier to sort out and handle in a practical sense. You can also use journaling to chronicle your goals for the future, personal victories from the day, or things that give you strength. Everyone I have talked to who has consistently done a gratitude list has said it’s had an overall positive impact on their mental state. A few people I know also use journaling time to write short stories and poems. Any of these things can be cathartic, and take away some of the internal weight we may not have realized we were carrying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I consume movies and television shows all the time – knowing I have a time slotted out every night or two often makes the workload of the term easier to stomach – but it’s come to my attention that I have somewhat lost my affinity for reading. I spent so much time accumulating used books to read as a means of saving up dopamine, but as soon as the winter began to approach I found myself converted to watching TV. I know that part of this is because I spend so much time reading for class, that it feels like the last thing I’d want to do is read for pleasure. But whenever I’ve chosen reading before bed over watching TV, my sleep has been much more smooth and restful. Over the five years I’ve been a Drexel student, winter term is always something I’ve dreaded. But, if I see it as an opportunity instead of something that will inevitably bring me down, maybe it doesn’t have to be. &nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In the latest installment of Seth MacFarlane's franchise, \"Ted\" makes an unexpected return in a prequel series on Peacock, taking viewers on a haphazard journey back to the 1990s. The seven-episode season explores the earlier days of Ted and his human friend John, offering a mix of crude humor, nostalgic references and attempts at familial depth.</p>\n<p>The show's premise revolves around a 16-year-old John Bennett and a Ted past his Hollywood heyday. The chemistry between Max Burkholder's John and MacFarlane's Ted remains a highlight, providing a glimpse into the origins of their enduring friendship. The visual effects for Ted are surprisingly good for television, and Burkholder's performance holds its own against the raunchy teddy bear's antics.</p>\n<p>While the show attempts to infuse humor into the familial dynamics, it often falls into the trap of tired stereotypes and predictable scenarios. The characters, including John's parents Matty and Susan and cousin Blaire, engage in politically incorrect banter and awkward situations, attempting to navigate the blurred lines between edgy humor and social commentary.</p>\n<p>The series, set in the 90s, leans heavily on nostalgia, incorporating references to pop culture artifacts from the era. However, this reliance on callbacks only sometimes contributes to the show's overall appeal, feeling more like a checklist than a meaningful exploration of the time period.</p>\n<p>\"Ted\" struggles with its format, opting for a binge-friendly release on Peacock. The brevity of the season, with episodes often exceeding the 30-minute mark, leaves little room for substantial character development or overarching narrative. The pacing issues become apparent as the show tries to cram in as many crude jokes as possible, sacrificing depth for quick laughs.</p>\n<p>The exploration of friendship and growing up, while present, lacks the depth needed to elevate the series beyond a mere comedy. John's family dynamics are introduced but have yet to be fully explored, leaving potential character development on the table. The emotional beats, while genuine, often feel formulaic and fail to leave a lasting impact.</p>\n<p>While the series retains MacFarlane's signature brand of dry humor and irreverence, it occasionally ventures into territory that feels more desperate than daring. Efforts to push boundaries with explicit language and mature themes often come across as formulaic rather than groundbreaking.</p>\n<p>Despite its shortcomings, \"Ted\" prompts genuine laughs in moments of absurdity and out-of-pocket scenes. The show's success lies in embracing its own ludicrous premise and not taking itself too seriously. Alanna Ubach's portrayal of Susan is a comedic gem, injecting much-needed energy into the family dynamic.</p>\n<p>Much like its predecessor, the original 'Ted' movie, and MacFarlane's renowned series Family Guy, the success of 'Ted' (2024) hinges heavily on the audience's individual taste for comedy and their tolerance for dark humor. As Shakespeare astutely observed, 'A jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it, never in the tongue of him that makes it.' This timeless insight underscores the subjective nature of humor, emphasizing that the effectiveness of a joke lies in the reception of the audience, making it clear that 'Ted' caters to those with a particular comedic inclination and an appreciation for the darker side of humor.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, \"Ted\" (2024) is a hit-and-miss experience that relies heavily on nostalgia, crude humor, and the enduring chemistry between a boy and his foul-mouthed teddy bear. While it may appeal to fans of MacFarlane's previous work, the series struggles to break new ground and falls short of recapturing the magic of the original \"Ted\" film.</p>\n<p>Ted is currently streaming on Peacock.

            "body_html": "<p>College, branded as a time for education but also self-discovery and freedom, can become damaging without the proper tools for success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A poll taken by the <u>Gallup and the Lumina Foundation</u> in March 2023 reported that out of 2,400 college students, 66 percent were experiencing stress and 51 percent reported “feelings of worry during a lot of the day.” Additionally, they also found that <u>emotional stress was reported to be one of the main reasons students considered dropping out in the fall 2022 semester.</u> The niche community of college students, who are very involved with the music, film and arts aspects of education, is at great risk of experiencing mental health issues as well.<a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>A recent survey</u></a> of 1500 independent musicians found that “73% have symptoms of mental health illness.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The individual needs of diverse communities like artists and musicians require solutions customized to their interests and individual needs.</p>\n<p>Emily “Noa” Silverman, a junior in graphic design who designs for the Drexel Theater Company, spoke about how &nbsp;she has employed good practices of stress relief such as drawing in her personal time. Many of her friends in fashion design have felt academic pressure due to Drexel’s fast pace with little support from educators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Silverman later spoke about how this affects the community on campus, mentioning how “we also don’t really have a community-based culture here, it’s all very work-oriented.”</p>\n<p>Speaking with a second-year fashion design student, who chose to remain anonymous, it was evident that artistic mediums like making music and drawing were significant stress relievers for her. She emphasized the importance of expressing her creativity amongst the rigorous nature of her major, considering the fast-paced nature of the quarter system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“For things not involving my degree, [the arts] are an outlet of expressionism for which I have no limitations. When feeling overwhelmed, it’s nice to have something to put your thoughts out to see for yourself.” She is not alone in this sentiment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>In a research review</u></a>, the American Psychiatric Association detailed surprising implications of music exposure on human well-being.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Specifically, music therapy was shown to have an “overall beneficial effect on stress-related outcomes” and be a useful tool to address serious mental health concerns</p>\n<p>Stevie Vagio, a freshman film and television major, partakes in many film classes and hands-on projects in the field. Vagio provided interesting insights into the unique mental health struggle experienced by people in his major/field.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Once in a while, I do feel burnt out due to the creativity demanded of my major,” Vagio said, bringing up an intriguing point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whereas a biology or engineering major may feel mental health challenges in the form of stress or anxiety over their workload, a film and television major struggles in a different way: creatively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creative burnout is “a major inhibitor for creative individuals that is often overlooked or dismissed” and should certainly be considered in the context of a college education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vagio had a notable solution to creative burnout and other mental health issues of arts and entertainment involving students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Having opportunities to submit films conveying their own mental health problems” could provide a unique outlet for students involved in film to relieve their stress.</p>\n<p>Micheal Messina, junior film and television major and member of the Drexel Entrepreneurial Game Studio, also mentions the stress that can come with doing projects in a collaborative program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He noted, “A lot of people are willing to work with you if you reach out to them, but I think that [educators] could do a better job at helping people who are not as comfortable reaching out to professors and students in general by maybe adding us all to a portal or somewhere where we can speak to each other that way.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Messina also mentioned the cultivation of student projects and how those can affect one's feelings about themselves and the program, as they allow for personal expression and creativity in a way that assignments might not.</p>\n<p>Cat LeFebvre, a freshman undecided design major, also had interesting insights into the issues and interventions applicable to students in her field. Whereas Vagio was more focused on the film and media aspects of arts and entertainment, LeFebvre discussed the fine arts aspect of the field.</p>\n<p>While LeFebvre agreed with Vagio about the risk of creative burnout, she also emphasized the importance of finding an art medium as a stress outlet that was “soothing, had reduced pressure and emphasized more of the work and less of the stress.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LeFebvre described her personal experiences doing physical things with her hands to assist her mental health, some examples being sketching and drawing on her notes. While she did mention art clubs and other student organizations that put on art therapy events such as drawing nights and t-shirt making, LeFebvre stressed the need for more non-club Drexel-sponsored events to support mental health, especially during finals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Little things like jazz nights and drawing nights can be something to consider,” LeFebvre suggested. “They don’t have to be big; they just have to be effective.”</p>\n<p>The points made by LeFebvre brought up another aspect of arts and entertainment mental health interventions that are overlooked: the accessibility of the programs. Freshman graphic design major Sarah Bonsall, has had her own mental health struggles but had some interesting perspectives on university-wide interventions for them: “It would be cool to have university-wide or dorm events that are easily accessible.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bonsall went on to describe the Westphal and graphic design schools as putting a large emphasis on mental health without ensuring that the resources are easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Professors can send students emails with steps that we can take to improve our mental health,” Bonsall suggested. “Even an information session during Welcome Week [with mental health resources and techniques for Westphal and design majors] would be helpful.”</p>\n<p>Acknowledging the important role that stress, burnout, exhaustion and other forms of mental health issues have on human wellbeing, the Central Federal Association of the Public Health Insurance Funds in Germany allocates funds to Creative Arts Therapies.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836011/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836011/\"><u>A scientific review published in 2018</u></a> describes CATs as being an intervention that “encompass[es] art, music, dance/movement, and drama therapy as their four major modalities” to approach individuals creatively and nonverbally.</p>\n<p>At the <u>University of Wisconsin</u>, the Student Health and Counseling Services adopted the practice of art therapy to support the wellbeing of the students in attendance. Their studies found that art therapy was incredibly beneficial to students, especially those who were undergoing culture shock from being in a different country or who were unable to express themselves as freely. Many found that CAT was a successful relief, as it allowed a new medium to express emotions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having scheduled events throughout the term, especially during times when students are experiencing high levels of stress (such as midterms and finals) may prove to be especially beneficial, to students who generally strive to employ the use of art, film, media and beyond as therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>This article is part of a </i><a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/the-triangle-wins-mental-health-grant-from-the-solutions-journalism-network/\"><i>grant awarded to The Triangle</i></a><i> from the </i><a href=\"https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/\"><i>Solutions Journalism Network</i></a><i> investigating student mental health at Drexel University.&nbsp;</i></p>",

The Nazis built Auschwitz and thousands of other camps <a href=\"https://https://khc.qcc.cuny.edu/camps/charts/\">to imprison and kill over 6 million Jews</a>. Humanity pledged “Never Again”... Never again would people be killed for their race or religion. Never again would humanity let this happen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of a relaxing winter break vacation, 13 Drexel students and I went to bear witness to the horrors of the Holocaust. We traveled with a group of Jewish students from various universities to see the death camps firsthand. It felt like we were in another world, but actually, this happened on Earth — our Earth. These atrocities were committed by people — regular people, just eighty years ago.</p>\n<p>We saw the ghettos, where Jews were forced to live and starve as rats. We touched the very cattle cars that shipped Jews off to the various camps. We visited concentration and death camps: chills went down our spines as we stepped through gas chambers, and crematoria. We mourned at a mass grave of Jewish children in a forest. We saw unimaginable things and unspeakable things. We felt such raw emotions and cried countless tears.</p>\n<p>Something powerful hit me in one of the gas chambers: This did not happen to “them.” It was not “the Jews.” It happened to me and my people. I am Jewish. These were my great uncles, aunts, cousins — my family. We were dehumanized and gassed, just for being Jewish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have one simple question: How?</p>\n<p>How did people buy into such propaganda?</p>\n<p>How could regular people become murderers?</p>\n<p>How could humanity do such a thing?</p>\n<p>Worst of all, I find myself asking, how is this happening to my people again?</p>\n<p>How can the then presidents of UPenn, Harvard, and M.I.T.<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/us/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism.html\"><u> openly say that calling for the genocide of Jews is not necessarily a violation of student conduct</u></a>? How can calling for genocide ever be acceptable?</p>\n<p>Never again is no longer a phrase. It is a necessity. Antisemitism is at record-breaking levels on campuses and cities around the world. The very week my group returned from Poland, a student praised Hitler on a Drexel whiteboard: How could they? It is not just words: My friends and I have been harassed and even attacked for showing our Judaism on campus. Why do we have to hide our Kippahs (Jewish head coverings) to feel safe?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust weeks after Oct. 7, a Penn student said she was “empowered and happy” because of the massacre. She encouraged everyone at a Philly rally to “<a href=\"https://https://nypost.com/2023/11/12/news/upenn-student-who-praised-glorious-hamas-terror-attack-stole-israeli-flag-is-idd/\">bring it to the streets</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How can never again truly mean never again?</p>",

It's high time we acknowledge the gravity of this condition and foster a broader understanding within our communities.</p>\n<p>In the realm of mental health, winter depression is more than just a fleeting mood swing; it's a substantial challenge to the emotional well-being of millions. The dwindling sunlight during the colder months disrupts the delicate balance of neurotransmitters, leading to symptoms ranging from persistent sadness to lethargy and, in severe cases, even contemplation of suicide.</p>\n<p>To comprehend the full impact of winter depression, we must dismiss the notion that it's a mere case of the \"winter blues.\" This is a real and often debilitating mental health issue, deserving of our attention and empathy. It's not a sign of weakness but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors that can affect anyone.</p>\n<p>Personal narratives shared by individuals battling winter depression provide a poignant insight into the varied experiences during these challenging months. From the college student tussling with academic pressures to the working professional managing daily responsibilities, winter depression is an equal-opportunity adversary, impacting lives in multifaceted ways.</p>\n<p>In our quest for a more compassionate society, it's imperative to strip away the stigma surrounding winter depression. Casual dismissals like \"it's just the winter blues\" undermine the severity of this condition and discourage those affected from seeking the help they need. Let's replace judgment with understanding, acknowledging that winter depression requires genuine support and care.</p>\n<p>Institutions, workplaces, and communities must create an environment that acknowledges and addresses winter depression. By fostering open conversations around mental health, providing accessible resources and implementing flexible support systems, we can collectively contribute to a society that prioritizes emotional well-being.</p>\n<p>While the battle against winter depression is complex, there are strategies to bolster personal resilience and foster a sense of well-being:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Embrace Light Therapy: Increased exposure to light, especially in the morning, can alleviate symptoms. Consider investing in a light therapy box designed to mimic natural sunlight.</li>\n  <li>Stay Active: Regular exercise is a powerful mood booster. Whether it is a brisk walk, a home workout, or a winter sport, incorporating physical activity into your routine can make a significant difference.</li>\n  <li>Prioritize Self-Care: Take time for activities that bring joy and relaxation. Whether it is reading, listening to music or engaging in a hobby, prioritizing self-care can positively impact mental well-being.</li>\n  <li>Connect with Others: Social connections are vital. Reach out to friends, family or support groups. Shared experiences and understanding can provide a sense of community.</li>\n  <li>Maintain a Routine: Establishing a consistent daily routine can help combat the inclination to withdraw during winter. Structure and predictability contribute to a sense of control.</li>\n  <li>Consider Professional Help: If winter depression persists, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor is essential. Therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have shown efficacy in managing SAD.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As winter settles in, let us not only empathize with those facing the challenges of winter depression but also empower ourselves and others with the tools to navigate the season with resilience and well-being. Winter is not just a season; it is an opportunity for personal growth and strength.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>February is Black History Month and one of the best ways to learn about Black history is at a museum. Philadelphia has a wide range of museums covering several historical topics, including African American history. For those who do not already know, Philadelphia was &nbsp;the capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800. These three museum options are for the folks interested in learning more about black history.</p>\n<p><u>Lest We Forget Museum of Slavery</u></p>\n<p>The Lest We Forget Museum of Slavery is in my view the most unique museum in the country. The artifacts within the museum are real and not kept behind glass. Shocking children’s toys and signs from the Jim Crow era line the walls and counters. A real Ku Klux Klan robe can be viewed right in front of you. Shackles that were almost guaranteed to have been used on African slaves are available for visitors to see. This museum does not shy away from the horrors of slavery. Instead, the founders of the museum provide a decade-by-decade lesson on the history of slavery up to the modern day. Through a detailed two-hour presentation, visitors learn how we got where we are with modern race relations. While the stories of some African Americans are discussed, such as Emmett Till, this museum focuses more on America’s overall history as a deeply racist country. For $20, visitors have the chance to see many items that are typically reserved for the eyes of anthropologists. Schedule an appointment through their website. Be prepared to see truly shocking things.</p>\n<p><u>African American Museum in Philadelphia (AAMP)</u></p>\n<p>The AAMP hosts events throughout Black History Month which can be looked up on their website. The museum covers a wide range of topics and includes interactive displays. The artwork featured in the museum is especially interesting. Visitors can expect to spend about an hour in this museum to see everything. Admission is $10 for students, but it can change based on the day you attend. For example, some days they will do $2 admission if it is a date of historical significance. Staff are always happy to answer questions so do not be too shy to ask. The best time to attend is in the morning when it is less crowded. This museum is much smaller than the National Museum of African American History and Culture, so do not expect to make an entire day out of it. Because of this museum’s close proximity to Chinatown, it can be a lot of fun to go to the museum in the morning and then get a dim sum lunch afterward. Parking is limited so you may be better off taking the Market-Frankford Line.</p>\n<p><u>National Museum of African American History and Culture</u></p>\n<p>Located in Washington, D.C., this enormous museum includes a seemingly endless amount of information on Black historical figures. This museum has everything in it. Topics include Black artists, culture, the Jim Crow era, slavery and Black success stories. Because of the expansive nature of this museum, it is possible to spend an entire afternoon here. The museum does require a timed ticket which can be reserved online, but it is free which cuts down on some of the costs associated with traveling to DC. On that note, this museum also requires a bit more planning to attend because it is not in Philadelphia. Still, it is worth the trip down to Washington, D.C. While you are in D.C. make sure to check out Sticky Fingers Diner. Their breakfast food is incredible.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of contemporary romance, Gen Z is undergoing a radical departure from traditional relationship norms, discarding the well-defined labels and commitments that have long characterized “love.” This generation, marked by an unwavering commitment to authenticity, is challenging societal expectations in an era where love transcends the conventional intricacies of tags and commitments.</p>\n<p>Historically, the human race has found relief in neatly defined relationship labels — boyfriend, girlfriend, engaged, married. Yet, Gen Z is navigating uncharted waters, disavowing these labels as relics of the past. In the epoch of 'situationships,' the demand for explicit commitments is becoming an antiquated notion. This generation understands love as a dynamic force, an ever-evolving entity that defies confinement within traditional relationship categories.</p>\n<p>At the core of Gen Z's love ethos lies a commitment to authenticity, one that steadfastly refuses to conform to the rigid expectations of the past. Rather than seeking validation through tags or commitments, Gen Z values the organic growth of relationships, allowing connections to unfold naturally, unencumbered by the weight of predefined expectations. In doing so, they seem to redefine the very essence of love. Or is that essence being lost?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traditionally, commitment was the bedrock of relationships, providing security in an uncertain world. Gen Z, however, is recalibrating the compass, leaving behind emotional connection, communication and mutual understanding. The focus has shifted from being the classic couple to cultivating moments of joy with no strings attached and hoping for these connections to be resilient.</p>\n<p>Enter 'situationships,' an informal dance between emotional and physical connection that epitomizes Gen Z's departure from conventional relationship structures. Rather than adhering to a predefined relationship escalator, Gen Z revels in the ambiguity of these situationships. Some say the journey is as significant as the destination, if not more so. The partner in this journey could always change since there is no name on the ticket.</p>\n<p>Love and relationships, in the eyes of Gen Z, have reduced to a simple transaction between two individuals, a dynamic force that adapts, grows, and morphs with the ebb and flow of life. The fluidity of these relationships allows individuals to explore their romantic and sexual identities without the constraints of predefined commitments. This generation prioritizes personal growth, autonomy and fulfillment on individual terms, reshaping the narrative of what it means to be in love.</p>\n<p>As we grapple with the complexities of modern relationships, it becomes imperative to shed societal expectations that confine love to specific tags or commitment statuses. Gen Z's perspective is of love as an evolving entity, free from the constraints of traditional norms. In this era, the essence of love still lies in the authenticity of connections, the depth of emotional understanding, and the feeling of putting your significant other and their needs over you.</p>\n<p>The big challenge is figuring out what love truly means in our fast and busy world.</p>\n<p>Relationships often seem like chance encounters in the web of modern connections. The deep and lasting feeling of love seems to be a bit old-fashioned. Commitments tend to be short-lived, and loyalty appears more commonplace in movies and TV shows than in reality. Those strong and lasting connections that used to make relationships special, now seem like rare occurrences. So, as we go through these short-lived romances, the real challenge lies in rediscovering what love truly means in our rapidly changing world.</p>\n<p>Gen Z is at the forefront of this change, leading us into a world where love knows no strict rules, evolves constantly, and breaks free from old-fashioned labels. Loyalty and vulnerability sometimes seem reserved for TV characters like Ted Mosby or Chandler Bing. Yet there are still people who remember the love from \"The Notebook\" and “Before We Go.” These individuals fight for their love, developing unbreakable bonds of trust, compromise, and dedication that act as a support system, which is needed in the modern era.</p>\n<p>So, the decision rests with Gen Z — whether to opt for a love that brings no discomfort and exists on borrowed time, or to endure the struggles of finding someone and, more importantly, sticking with them. It is about learning the value and satisfaction of enduring love, echoing the sentiments from a time when love wasn't just a fleeting moment but a lifelong commitment.</p>",

Posts about high tuition, chronic loneliness, inconsiderate roommates and the return of COVID-19 beg the question: Are Drexel students happy?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The short answer is no; if anything the vast majority of Drexel students posting online are unhappy. While this article will provide at least one viable suggestion, this article will conveniently be published about a month before transfer applications are due.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the Fizz app, there are various sections. For those living under a rock, the Drexel University Fizz is organized into three distinct feeds. The first section contains Top posts, which have been most upvoted by other students in the Drexel fizz community, the second is Fizzin’, dedicated to posts that have recently been posted but are receiving a lot of attention, and lastly, the New section which is self-explanatory. The New feed makes you wonder if Drexel students are trying too hard to be funny or just majorly depressed.</p>\n<p>Exhibit A: Two screenshots were posted on the app on Wednesday, Jan. 31 side by side.

My Scooter was stolen right outside of URBN center (34th and market) while I was in class from 12:20-12:50 p.m. today”…. Yap…yap… make and model… yap…yap…yap.. “I have filed a police report.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second screenshot is a blacker picture on the Drexel class of 2027 story captioned “Selling my scooter $250,” “Price is negotiable” and “add me if you want,” It is not funny on paper but if you are trying to find it the user name of the poster is “Anonymous.”</p>\n<p>But by far we can all agree the best Fizz posts are observational. However, some observations need not be shared with everyone like one post from Anonymous reading, “I got 10 hours of sleep like a good student… unfortunately it does actually make a difference.” I don’t know about y’all but I don’t need to hear about how awesome your sleep schedule is compared to mine… unfortunately, some of us are not marketing majors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The true issue I find with this app is once you get off it for a few days, your feed is flooded with jokes you do not understand. For example, anyone who was not using Fizz during its debut week probably would not understand the inconsiderate roommate reference. To anyone who did get the reference, please consider going on a walk, trying yoga or at the very least posting some funnier content. The only thing spreading faster than Fizz posts on campus is the realization that maybe we should all transfer to a school with a better sense of humor.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>What do you think is the most stressful part about co-op application season? The obvious answers might be the anxiety about getting a job, the fear of rejection, the fact that your interviews always align with finals or realizing you were broke after engaging in some retail therapy. But all of those answers are wrong. The actual reason why co-op application season is so stressful is the co-op portal — a portal that looks so old that it will probably be running for president in 2024. Someone should have told them to wear more sunscreen.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s pride and joy is co-op, so tell me why it feels like I am Sisyphus pushing his rock uphill whenever I use the portal. If you want to know where Drexel’s priorities lie, look no further than the payment portal, which is so clean and slick it would make the TikTok girlies jealous. It’s clear who the favorite child is, and it is not the one they brag about to all the relatives at Thanksgiving. It's simple really: we use the pretty payment portal, Drexel gets our money, and they spend it on [checks notes] a SEPTA station. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The co-op portal is such a topsy-turvy mess that I swear it was that one labyrinth David Bowie was trying to navigate in that one movie. Each page seems to have an individuality complex because there is zero uniformity at all. And yeah, differences should be celebrated or whatever, but not when they all have the same color scheme, making it all the more confusing. “Hey, you can copy my homework, just change the answers a little.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The craziest part about this is the fact we have an entire major dedicated to user experience and interaction design. Why can’t we use one of them to fix our co-op portal? It could be their senior project, or better yet, make it a co-op. It would be a mini pyramid scheme: Drexel hires a student for a co-op to help other kids get a co-op.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can’t imagine what their employers think, when they see how antiquated the interface looks. “This is Drexel’s portal? Aren’t they supposed to be a cutting-edge research institution? Why does this portal make me feel like I’m using Internet Explorer?” They are really setting us up, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>And then once you finally get a co-op, you are still not done with this hellscape that Drexel calls a “tool for opportunity.” Now you have to sign a contract, which might seem simple, but it isn’t. Why is the contract page so hard to find? This is not a scavenger hunt. Why do I have to find my contract the same way I find chocolate eggs the Easter Bunny lays out?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Can I make some suggestions for a revamped co-op portal? Idea 1: Make the interface look like it was created in the 21st century. They did this once with DegreeWorks, why not again? And you know what will be fun? Fireworks when you submit your applications. The little rewards in life, they make all the difference. Idea 2: Move to print. If they want to look so antiquated, might as well go all the way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyways, as Drexel always says, Ambition Can’t Wait…for the co-op portal to load.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 women, 1 in 4 men, and 1 in 2 transgender-identifying individuals will be in an abusive relationship in their lifetime. Many people enjoy their first romantic relationship while attending university, but most people were never taught what a healthy relationship looks like. The One Love Foundation, an organization that works to end relationship abuse, lists these ten signs of a healthy relationship so that you can make sure your relationship is a healthy one:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><b>Comfortable Pace </b>The relationship moves at a speed that feels enjoyable for each person. It is normal to want to spend a lot of time with someone when you first meet them, but it is important that you are both on the same page with how the relationship is moving. In a healthy relationship, you are not rushed or pressured in a way that makes you feel overwhelmed.</li>\n  <li><b>Trust </b>Confidence that your partner will not do anything to hurt you or ruin the relationship. In a healthy relationship, trust comes easily and you do not have to question the other person’s intentions or whether they have your back. They respect your privacy and would never put you through a “test” to prove your loyalty.</li>\n  <li><b>Honesty </b>You can be truthful and candid without fearing how the other person will respond. In a healthy relationship, you should feel like you can share the full truth about your life and feelings with each other. They may not like what you have to say, but will respond to disappointing news in a considerate way.</li>\n  <li><b>Independence </b>You have space to be yourself outside of the relationship. The other person should be supportive of your hobbies and your relationships with other friends, family and coworkers. Having independence means being free to do you and giving your partner that same freedom.</li>\n  <li><b>Respect </b>You value one another’s beliefs and opinions, and love one another for who you are as a person. You feel comfortable setting boundaries and are confident that the other person will respect those boundaries. They cheer for you when you achieve something, support your hard work and dreams, and appreciate you.</li>\n  <li><b>Equality </b>The relationship feels balanced and everyone puts the same effort into the success of the relationship. You don’t let one person’s preferences and opinions dominate, and instead, you hear each other out and make compromises when you don’t want the same thing.</li>\n  <li><b>Kindness </b>You are caring and empathetic to one another, and provide comfort and support. In a healthy relationship, the other person will do things that they know will make you happy. Kindness should be a two-way street – it is given and returned in your relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><b>Taking Responsibility </b>Owning your actions and words. You avoid placing blame and are able to admit when you make a mistake. You can take ownership for the impact your words or behavior had, even if it was not your intention.</li>\n  <li><b>Healthy Conflict </b>Openly and respectfully discussing issues and confronting disagreements in a non-judgmental way. Conflict is a normal and expected part of any relationship. Healthy conflict is recognizing the root issue and addressing it respectfully before it escalates into something bigger. No one should belittle or yell during an argument.</li>\n  <li><b>Fun </b>You enjoy spending time together and you bring out the best in each other. A healthy relationship should feel easy and make you happy. You can let loose, laugh together and be yourselves — the relationship does not bring your mood down, but cheers you up.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Make a commitment to developing healthy relationships this Valentine's Day. Love is a skill that takes work. Everyone does unhealthy things in relationships. Nobody is perfect, but we can all learn to love better and have healthier relationships.</p>\n<p>The One Love Foundation is interested in bringing educational opportunities to student groups who are interested in learning more about healthy relationships.

            "body_html": "<p>best ways to soendWhether you celebrate Valentine's with your significant other, “Gal”entines with your girls, or “Pal”entines with your friends, the season of love is back in Philadelphia. As the City of Brotherly Love, it should come as no surprise that there is no shortage of festive activities this February in and around the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t</p>\n<p>When thinking of Valentine's Day, themes of love and bright pink hearts are usually some of the first to mind. Though Philadelphia captures this love all year round with the LOVE Statue at LOVE Park, the holiday brings an additional festival to the area. On Feb. 14 starting at noon, LOVE Park will host the Make Love Market Extravaganza. This themed event will have vendors from around the city, music, holiday photo-ops, and even speed dating at 6 p.m. Though the Make Love Market ends at 8 p.m., the fun does not have to stop there. At Penn’s Landing, Winterfest will host a special event called the Sweetheart Skate. This event will go from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., and skating is not the only event on the table. There are roses, music, couples’ crafts, keepsake photos, and a free hot chocolate per ticket purchased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t</p>\n<p>Something else Philadelphia does well around the holidays is food. Whether you are looking for a fancy restaurant or a Valentine's-themed treat, this city has you covered. For a nice dinner option, a Dinner Cruise on the Delaware River is offered by Philadelphia City Cruises. This date night features music, flowers, delicious food and a wonderfully unique setting. If a black-tie dinner is not what you are looking for, many places around the city hold festive but casual baking experiences. In King of Prussia at the Chef’s Place, there is a macaron baking class offered a few times during the Valentine’s season. This course has a fee but is all-inclusive with everything you need to make the night successful. The class is led by a professional chef and is sure to be a memorable and delicious way to celebrate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t</p>\n<p>If you are a Swiftie or a tea-lover, the Mary Cassatt Tea Room at The Rittenhouse is holding a Galentine’s Tea. The event will run the weekend before Valentine’s Day and does require participants to pre-register. The tea blends will be inspired by Taylor Swift’s eras, and this will be a special way to spend the holiday of love with the friends and musicians you love the most. Another unique experience is being offered on Feb. 10 by the Fabric Workshop and Museum. This experience allows participants to make their own love-inspired pillowcases and learn about screen printing. If you love trying new and creative art forms, this event is for you – and it comes with a keepsake you can cherish forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe going out is not very appealing to you. A night in can be rejuvenating and exciting. There are plenty of ways to celebrate Valentine’s from the comfort of your home. One essential ingredient to an at-home celebration is themed snacks. The website Insanely Good Recipes has a Valentine’s article with linked recipes to help you along your journey. Some of the highlights include heart-shaped pizza and heart-shaped cookies. Once your snacks are in order, it is essential to pick a fun activity to do. Being creative can always be fun, so pick up some painting supplies, coloring sheets, or craft kits that fit the theme. It can also be fun to write love letters, even platonic ones, to show the people in your life how much you care about them. Finish off the night with a nice movie. Rom-coms are always solid picks. Scroll through the seasonal section on Netflix, and you are sure to find a movie that fits your taste. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t</p>\n<p>Celebrating a holiday is festive and fun, and the beauty of Valentine's Day is that you celebrate love with the people you love the most. Philadelphia is a great city to be in, as it has no shortage of activities for the season. There are many exciting and niche opportunities around the city that can help this be your best Valentine’s yet. Gather your significant other, besties or buddies and start planning a Valentine’s Day that you will absolutely love.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2358709/\"><u>Nathan Fielder</u></a> is modern television’s master of discomfort. The Canadian comedian first rose to prominence with his docu-reality show “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2297757/\"><u>Nathan For You</u></a>,” in which he employs his business background to execute eccentric schemes to increase profits for small companies. Through this series, Fielder developed a reputation for injecting his projects with a distinctly offbeat essence. A similar ambience permeated his follow-up show “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10802170/\"><u>The Rehearsal</u></a>,” although more of its focus seemed dedicated to eliciting philosophical reflection than merely providing a vehicle for attention-grabbing humor. Formulated around the idea of allowing subjects to rehearse for big life moments via elaborately crafted simulations, Fielder’s sophomore series sought to grapple with the blurred lines between reality and fiction. This thematic through-line persists into Fielder’s latest dark comedy series “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13623608/\"><u>The Curse</u></a>” in such a way that is equally uncomfortable and mesmerizing to watch. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Produced by <a href=\"https://a24films.com/\"><u>A24</u></a> and co-created by Fielder along with filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1509478/\"><u>Benny Safdie</u></a>, “The Curse” follows newlyweds Asher (Fielder) and Whitney Siegal (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015/\"><u>Emma Stone</u></a>) as they begin production on a freshly greenlit HGTV show. The concept behind the Siegals’ envisioned show, titled Flipanthropy, is to document their ill-founded attempts to uplift the community present in the city of Española, New Mexico. Headed by cunningly manipulative TV producer Dougie Schecter (Safdie), the Siegals’ questionable project soon spirals into a complicated web of deception, paranoia, and ulterior motives that calls into question the moral fiber of the parties involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The Curse” bears a captivating peculiarity that flows throughout its every aspect, nonchalantly sticking out like a sore thumb amidst the endless sea of content that is modern television. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0084128/\"><u>Maceo Bishop</u></a>’s cinematography and the shot composition embody a noticeable voyeuristic quality. Many of the scenes are shot at considerable distances from the characters and take on unconventional angles, slowly panning as if to discretely track various movements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this way, the show’s visual language bears more resemblance to a hidden camera affair like “Impractical Jokers” than a scripted drama. There are, in fact, several moments captured from behind the cover of plants or around the corner of a wall. These deliberate creative decisions add a fascinating dual effect. On one hand, it allows viewers to feel more ingrained in the narrative as if they are receiving a secret peek into the characters’ lives. But it also feels creepily alienating, as though the audience is not meant to witness certain encounters unfold. The unusual cinematography present in “The Curse” is a strikingly simple example of establishing a distinct style without needing to be particularly revolutionary or extravagant. Keyboardist and composer <a href=\"https://www.johnmedeski.com/\"><u>John Medeski</u></a>’s score demonstrates similar restraint whilst contributing much to the intended atmosphere. Its reliance on distorted synths, odd rhythms and entrancing melodies further submerges viewers in the show’s alluringly weird depths.</p>\n<p>These elements in conjunction with the off-putting nature of the leading characters complete the show’s omnipresent sense of disturbing intrigue. The opening minutes of the series succinctly establish the tone and character dynamics that uphold the remainder of the season. It features Asher, Whitney, and Dougie filming a scene for Flipanthropy, which involves an interview with a pair of Española natives. Asher is imbued with Fielder’s signature deadpan delivery, giving the impression that he’s simply reciting lines from an internalized script with no conveyed interest. Whitney evokes a similar synthetic sympathy, with Emma Stone brilliantly capturing the facade of compassion her character assumes whenever interacting with the Española community. Meanwhile, Safdie’s Dougie insists on over-dramatizing the exchange to add heightened emotion to the show. It is undoubtedly an uncomfortable yet amusing preamble to the series, as it becomes immediately apparent that these characters’ outward behaviors and mannerisms are not founded upon any sort of sincere care for the community. Consequently, it makes viewers distrust the central protagonists from the very start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For that reason, many may find themselves repelled from continuing on the 10-episode journey with this trio of characters. They are a set of pathetically twisted individuals and the show does not attempt to provide the illusion that viewers are supposed to root for them. Quite the opposite holds true throughout most of the runtime, presenting a boundless slew of moments that seem determined to leave audiences utterly disgusted or embarrassed. However, through a miraculous mixture of finely tuned screenwriting and the superb believability of each performance, the characters are never reduced to poorly defined caricatures. Though most of the series proves an unsettling watch, it can be argued this result is achieved through the immense depths to which these characters are fleshed out and developed. Perhaps what is most disturbing is the show’s unbridled ambition to feature fully realized protagonists who reflect the most disconcerting aspects of ourselves, drawing from the darkest, most veiled wells of humanity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In keeping with the distressing undertones of Fielder’s previous projects, “The Curse,” at its core, demonstrates humanity’s self-inflicted dishonesty as a means of holding firmer control over our perceived world. As exemplified by the show’s overarching themes, it is common for us to utilize fabricated fiction as a means to reduce certain fears and insecurities regarding cruel realities. In exploring this subject matter, Fielder and company present an uncompromisingly divisive vision, evidenced by its <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_curse_2023\"><u>mixed reception among general audiences</u></a>. While abundantly lacking in mass appeal, for those willing to push through its oftentimes skin-crawlingly strange reaches, “The Curse” offers an experience like no other, seeping with artistic value. All episodes of “The Curse” are now streaming exclusively on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>When you think fashion, you might think “<a href=\"https://catalog.drexel.edu/undergraduate/collegeofmediaartsanddesign/\"><u>Westphal College of Media Arts and Design</u></a><u>,</u>” as the school is known for its fashion design and design and merchandising majors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a psychology major myself, fashion and styling clothes are some of my favorite hobbies. Although I decided not to pursue fashion as a career path, it continues to play a part in my everyday life. I wanted to see if fashion's importance and different types of styles varied from major to major. I asked a couple of students from different majors here at Drexel to test this theory.</p>\n<p>Software Engineering: Kaaviya Senthil is a second-year software engineering major at Drexel. When asked on a scale of 1-10 how important fashion is to her, she claimed it landed at an 8. Senthil expressed her enjoyment of dressing in a way that makes her feel confident and good about herself. The majority of the fashion in her major and environment consists of “sweatpants, hoodies, shorts, and t-shirts.” Senthil continued, “That’s not to say that there aren’t people that dress the way I would take inspiration from, but the majority of the people I encounter tend to not have the same fashion style that I do.” Fashion trends Senthil is currently a fan of include baggy/oversized clothing. The versatility of this style allows her to create multiple outfits out of a few basics. “I'm also really into low-rise pants and I'''ve been wanting to accessorize more,” added Senthil. Three words Senthil would use to describe her current style include “Casual, minimalist, and neutral.”</p>\n<p>Design and Merchandising: At Westphal, Kunaal Krishnan is a second-year D&amp;M major. With fashion being very important to him, Krishnan rates it a 10. “Fashion is one of the core foundations of self-expression alongside music and art. The way someone dresses says a lot about themselves and how they choose to represent themselves in the world,” Krishnan explains. When asked if he thought his major and the environment he’s in influences the way he dresses, Krishnan claimed that everyone in his classes “throws a fit on,” encouraging him to reciprocate. He believes that our hobbies, music taste, personality, environment, and the people around us influence our style. Krishnan describes the style of his classmates as dressing fancy and “things you would see in a magazine.” Krishnan claims to not really follow trends and instead find what he likes on his own. The all-black look is something he has recently been enjoying, along with being attracted to “unique-looking garments rather than graphics.” Krishnan's current style can be summed up in three words: “Diverse, reflective and skater.”</p>\n<p>Business: Taking all of her classes at Lebow, Laura Ibrahim is a first-year management information systems major. Fashion has never been a main priority for Ibrahim, but lands at a 6 on the importance scale. Although she sees the importance of wanting to dress well, Ibrahim finds it difficult in college to “find the motivation to wear nicer outfits to class because I’d rather opt to wear things that make me feel comfortable.” Ibrahim's peers are described as dressing in “just a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt of sorts. Especially in the winter months, it’s a lot of blacks and blues, not a lot of variety in color.” With this being the case, the thought of dressing differently and wearing clothes that don’t “fit in” amongst her peers, pushes away Ibrahim's desire to branch out into other fashion choices. A fashion trend Ibrahim is into right now is vintage-style sweaters, “They don’t feel as basic to me as a sweatshirt but they provide comfort in the same way,” she claims. Three words Ibrahim would use to describe her fashion sense are “comfortable, simple, and neutral.”</p>\n<p>I think it is safe to say there is a significant contrast in the importance of fashion within majors. The diversity of perspectives on Drexel’s campus reiterates the idea of self-expression and personal style. As someone extremely qualified (I just like clothes), I encourage you all to wear what you are comfortable in and create your own personal style!</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In case you missed the abundance of heart-shaped tchotchkes crowding the isles of your closest CVS, Valentine's Day is just around the corner. Whether you are celebrating with your significant other, a group of friends or avoiding the festivities &nbsp;altogether, there is no better way to enjoy the holiday than a romantic movie. Here is a list of (mostly) rom-coms for every occasion.</p>\n<p>When Harry Met Sally… (1989)</p>\n<p>I mean…it would be stupid NOT to put “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/\"><u>When Harry Met Sally...</u></a> ” on here. Meeting briefly during a ride-share together to New York City, the movie follows Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) as they continue to run into each other over the course of 12 years. The two become closer, worrying that sex may put their friendship in jeopardy. Between the iconic final monologue and the classic “will they, won’t they” romance trope, “When Harry Met Sally…” is a staple of the rom-com genre that continues to solidify its popularity.</p>\n<p>10 Things I Hate About You (1999)</p>\n<p>A modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Taming of the Shrew,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/\"><u>10 Things I Hate About You</u></a>” opens with Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new student at Padua High, in his attempt to date Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik). In order to do so, however, Bianca’s cold and cynical older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) must ALSO have a date. With the help of two other students, Cameron enlists Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to take Kat out. Filled with Shakespearean drama, a star-studded cast and 90s nostalgia, “10 Things I Hate About You” is the perfect classic rom-com to throw on with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>50 First Dates (2004)</p>\n<p>If you love Adam Sandler movies but wish they would focus more on the “inexplicably attractive woman falls for Adam Sandler for some reason” storyline, look no further than “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/\"><u>50 First Dates</u></a><u>.</u>” After Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) hits it off with Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), he is surprised when he sees her again and she has no recollection of their previous meeting. Roth eventually finds out she suffers from short-term memory loss, leading him on a series of “first” dates in an attempt to regain Whitmore’s memory and foster a relationship. Sandler’s cast of usual suspects, including Rob Schnieder, Maya Rudolph and Jonathan Loughran, add a comfortable sense of familiarity to the movie. Coupled with Sandler’s stylized humor, “50 First Dates” is great if you are looking for something a little less romantic and a little more funny.</p>\n<p>Blue Valentine (2010)</p>\n<p>Unlike Adam Sandler’s “50 First Dates,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1120985/\"><u>Blue Valentine</u></a>” is a little more romantic and a lot less funny. The film introduces Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams), a struggling married couple balancing their professional and personal lives. Jumping between the beginnings of their relationship and the present, the audience can piece together their romantic timeline and what led them to their current standings. Director Derek Cianfrance can painfully capture the internal battle of a difficult question: How long can the relationship highs justify the lows? If you are sick of lovey-dovey movies, “Blue Valentine” is the ideal anti-romance movie to protest Valentine’s Day.</p>\n<p>La La Land (2016)</p>\n<p>Often deemed a modern classic, “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/\"><u>La La Land</u></a>” has everything you could ask for in a romance movie: captivating visuals, a heartbreaking love story and 15 musical numbers. The film follows two protagonists: Mia Dolan (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist. Despite meeting each other in a fit of road rage, the two begin a whirlwind romance as they navigate the ups and downs of their professional careers. Whether you are watching for the cinematography, Stone and Gosling’s chemistry, or Justin Hurwitz's near-perfect soundtrack, “La La Land” has something for everyone.</p>\n<p>Someone Great (2019)</p>\n<p>Valentine's Day is not just for couples, but for gals and pals that celebrate the love of friendship. This Galentine's Day we will be watching Netflix’s 2019 movie \"Someone Great<i>.</i>\" After breaking up with her boyfriend, \"Jane the Virgin’\"s Gina Rodriguez goes on an adventure with her two best friends before moving away. Breaking up with your long-term partner is never the end of the world at whatever point you are at in your life when you have your gals by your side.</p>\n<p>Anyone But You (2023)</p>\n<p>Looking for a new fan-favorite comedy in your local theater? We highly recommend &nbsp;you check out \"Anyone But You.\" Junior Ashley Rukab said, “I watched it in theaters, and it single-handedly saved rom-coms.” \"Anyone But You\" features the duo Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell leaving you wondering how they are not a couple in real life. &nbsp;Just look at their social media. It was not even five seconds until I added \"Unwritten\" by Natasha Bedingfield to my Spotify playlist. Maybe that is my new comfort song too, thanks Glen. &nbsp;<br/>\n<br/>\nThough Valentine’s Day may not be for everyone, these movies are perfect for date night, girls' night or pure boredom. These are just a few highlights from the romance genre, but a few honorable mentions include Nora Ephron’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/\"><u>Sleepless in Seattle</u></a><u>,</u>” Marc Webb’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/\"><u>500 Days of Summer</u></a><u>,</u>” Mike Newell’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/\"><u>Four Weddings and a Funeral</u></a><u>,</u>” Carrie Cracknell’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13456318/\"><u>Persuasion</u></a><u>,</u>” Adam Shankman’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209475/\"><u>The Wedding Planner</u></a>” and Roger Michell’s “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125439/\"><u>Notting Hill</u></a><u>.</u>”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hopefully, our Cupid’s Watchlist makes it onto your screens this upcoming Valentine's Day.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Before he was a presidential candidate, billionaire and engaged in antisemitic behavior, Kanye West was a 26-year-old music producer on the verge of releasing his debut album, \"The College Dropout.\" At the time, the hip-hop industry was flooded with so-called “gangster rappers,” usually hailing from either New York City or Los Angeles and nowhere in between. What room did this leave for an art student from Chicago? Someone who wore a Polo and a backpack? Someone with seemingly no connections in the rap game? Very little. In fact, it took Kanye nearly a decade in the industry to even get to the point where he could put out an album, due to many thinking he simply didn’t have what it took to make it as a solo artist.</p>\n<p>This was 20 years ago. The Kanye of today has replaced the Polo and backpack with some of the most unusual outfits ever seen and has succeeded in seemingly every way possible in terms of his career. However, in terms of who he is as a person, he has time and time again fallen short, often in the public eye for everyone to witness. As a result, many are left wondering what happened to the conscious, yet positive and confident Kanye that was seen at the beginning of his career.</p>\n<p>On \"The College Dropout<i>,\" </i>Kanye makes himself known from the very first song, “We Don’t Care.” Throughout the song, Kanye, eventually joined by a children’s choir, repeats the refrain “We don’t care what people say.” This line essentially becomes the mantra for not only the rest of the album but also Kanye’s career as a whole. From the start of his career, Kanye has been known for pioneering new sounds, whether it be the heavy use of autotune on albums like \"808s and Heartbreak,\" or the more industrial instrumentals on \"Yeezus.\" On \"Dropout,\" this is what has come to be known as “chipmunk soul.” The style, introduced by West, is trademarked by sped-up soul samples and is a style that is seen on several songs across the record. These include the tracks “School Spirit,” “Last Call,” “Slow Jamz,” and “Through The Wire.” The latter song, which served as the album’s lead single, originally featured West rapping with his mouth wired shut following a near-fatal car accident that shattered his entire jaw.</p>\n<p>Several times since the song was first released, West has stated that the accident was the reason he decided to commit himself to a solo career. For years prior, West had desired to start rapping on his own beats and releasing his own music. However, he was pressured against doing so by members of his own label, Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records. But after the accident Kanye realized he didn’t have much time to waste, recording the song as soon as it was physically possible, then eventually persuading Jay-Z to let him release it. The song’s success proved that, if nothing else, Kanye could sell a record, so the label let him go ahead and do his thing. “Through The Wire” was followed by the aforementioned “Slow Jamz,” which reached #1 with some help from Jamie Foxx and a sped-up Luther Vandross sample. From these two songs alone, it became clear that Kanye had a formula that worked. Although “Through the Wire” contained pretty serious subject matter, several songs on the album are defined by their fun, relatively unserious lyrics filled with clever punchlines, very much deviating from the hardcore content that was mainstream at the time. Songs like “Slow Jamz” and “School Spirit” are good examples of this, as well as songs like “Get Em High,” “Breathe In Breathe Out,” and “The New Workout Plan.” None of these tracks discuss anything that important but are simply enjoyable to listen to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, Kanye makes it very early on in the record that if he has something to say, he’s going to say it, a trait that has led him to some of the highest highs and lowest lows of his career. But in terms of \"Dropout,\" this is usually a good thing, for it allows &nbsp;&nbsp;Kanye to touch on things that seem very near and dear to his heart. Take the album’s second full song, “All Falls Down.” Right after claiming that he “[doesn’t] care what people say,” Kanye speaks his truth about the issues he sees in his community, particularly the negative effects of consumerism and the materialistic mindsets many seem to have, including himself. He then goes on to discuss the problems he sees in the modern work environment in “Spaceship,” before speaking on his family and overall familial relationships in “Family Business.” He and Mos Def trade verses about inner-city life on “Two Words,” with Kanye’s vivid depiction of his Chicago past making it one of his best verses to date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite how personal all of these songs feel, none is as powerful either to the listener or seemingly Kanye himself as “Jesus Walks.” On the track, West discusses his relationship with Jesus, as well as religion as a whole. He describes the role he believes God plays in his life, which until this point was never really discussed in mainstream hip-hop. West even acknowledges this point on the track when he asks “If I talk about God my record won’t get played?” He goes on to state that even something as brutal as murder can be depicted in song with no repercussions, but even mentioning Jesus could have devastating effects on his career. For an artist just getting his start, this is an incredibly bold move and one that can be respected regardless of anyone’s religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>20 years later, it is no surprise that Kanye would make a decision like this. Every choice he makes seems to be determined by him and him only. Musically, this is often a good thing. Kanye’s willingness to go against the grain and create sounds that are unheard of for their time has led to some of the greatest projects in recent mainstream music, influencing countless artists in the process. Everything outside of his music is a completely different story, with the same mindset seemingly having a lot to do with his rapidly crumbling reputation. But, if \"The College Dropout\" says anything, it’s that Kanye honestly is not worried in the slightest about what people think about him. This mentality is the hill that Kanye chooses to die on; the hill he has both climbed and fallen down time and time again throughout his career and seemingly will continue to do so for a long, long time.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>At some point this or last week, you might have received an email about participating in a focus group conducted by an independent researcher in early February. The purpose of these focus groups is to find out how students feel about a potential switch to a semester system and “university-wide common core.” You might be feeling like the choice is obvious — waist-deep into week four with midterms begin rolling in that, depending on your major, may not stop until finals — of course &nbsp;you would prefer a semester system. Your friends at semester schools enjoy a syllabus week, your friends at semester schools don’t take finals before their spring break, your friends at semester schools are not in classes late into June or over the summer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But you have things your friends at semester schools don’t have. Whether you realize it or not, if you are passing your classes, you have developed incredible time management skills doing in ten weeks what most students do in fifteen to twenty. Drexel’s co-op program, made possible by the quarter system, adds value to your resume, both in the experience itself and the reputation of the program for employers. Most of the working world beyond college operates on a quarterly basis. You can take a lot more classes than semester students can.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the current student opinion on the system, it seems the motivation behind the switch is increasing enrollment. &nbsp;I am sure there is data that suggests many students turn their offers down because they’re not interested in going to school over the summer (though most college students are in classes or working over the summer break regardless).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But even so, if you were to ask yourself or your peers why you chose this school in particular, what would your answer be? For the times I have asked and been asked this question, the answer is not the windy Philadelphia winters– it’s almost always about co-op.</p>\n<p>This decision should absolutely not be made without a solid plan for preserving the integrity of the co-op program, which sees success because of the nature of the quarter system. Regardless of your personal feelings about it, it is Drexel’s biggest selling point. No other university does this exactly like we do — a streamlined process that has associated itself with the reputation of our school for employers, a program that allows students to accomplish more work experience than a traditional college summer internship and one that exposes students to the interview process as early as their second year. While students at traditional universities hunt down internships across multiple sources with varying luck, Drexel students search through a database that, depending on one’s major, could have more options than they know what to do with. Like it or not, with some improvements, it gives our school a competitive edge no other school in the area has.</p>\n<p>If the intention of moving to a semester system is to retain more applicants, I would argue that changing the academic schedule would not make much of a difference. Stanford University, the University of California suite, Dartmouth University and plenty of other great schools get by just fine by operating quarterly. In the admissions world today, where universities are fighting for the enrollment of dwindling classes each year, there seem to be other factors contributing to choice. My guesses are affordability (generally), prestige, value and location. It should be a serious consideration for the voting committee whether or not a switch to the semester system would truly increase any of these values– excluding location, of course. Have we weighed the merits of leaning into the uniqueness of our model?</p>\n<p>From one student’s perspective, here are a few relatively realistic things that might actually help enrollment and retainment: an investment into the refurbishment of the Steinbright Career Development Center’s website, stronger relationships with potential co-op employers and better promoting of the co-op program and the benefits of learning on a quarterly system to prospective students. Additionally, more of a focus on student voice and involvement, transparency between the administration, faculty and student body, investment into student and faculty mental health resources and a larger focus on accessibility and availability of third spaces for students would all help.</p>\n<p>I could go on and I am sure many of you could, too. But the main idea boils down to this – abolishment of the quarter system would eliminate many of the things that make this university competitive and unique. In other words: if we are afraid of falling victim to the problems that plague so many other universities, why would we so badly want to be just like them?</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Amaris Baker is a junior guard in her first year at Drexel, having transferred from Harcum College in Bryn Mawr, where she led the Bears to a 30-4 record, their most successful season ever. She has been a starter in every game for the Dragons thus far, factoring in as a crucial part of their 4-3 record in conference play. Last week, The Triangle sat down with Baker to discuss her decision to transfer to Drexel, her season so far and her future at the University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>James Biernat</b>: You’re from the Philly area originally, what was it like getting the call from Coach Mallon and what went into deciding to transfer to Drexel?<br/>\n<b>Amaris Baker</b>: It was awesome. I always wanted to play college basketball back at home after my experience my freshman year [at Kennesaw State]. I wanted to be close to family and have that atmosphere, so when I got that call and had a conversation with Coach Mallon it was awesome. I mean, when I went on my visit I just knew this was the place for me, so it was a great conversation with her.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<b>JB</b>: That’s great to hear. Last year you led all of NJCAA Division 2 in scoring and averaged 27 points per game. What’s been the biggest challenge for you in transitioning that scoring ability to Division 1 play?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: Having people who can score with me has taken that pressure off me which has felt great. I’ve learned how to adjust with everything that was going on and being in a new place. Its definitely been a big jump, but I’ve been able to adjust very well.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<b>JB</b>: I’d say so, you’ve had a great last two weeks. You recorded your first double double, set your career high in points and won back-to-back Drexel female athlete of the week. Was there any advice from a coach or teammate that’s helped you elevate your play recently?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: All of my coaches honestly. I’ve been in the gym every single day, whether it’s with Stacy [Weiss] or Coach Kayla [Bacon] and having conversations with Coach Amy [Mallon] about anything. That’s helped me develop and helped me mentally be in the right headspace to perform well.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<b>JB</b>: I have to ask, now that you’re in University City, what’s your go to spot on campus for a post game meal?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: Shake Shack. Definitely when we score over 70 points. If not, I'll go to Cinnabon. I just need something sweet to lighten my day.<br/>\n<b>JB</b>: Yeah, they just put in a new Cinnabon on Lancaster.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>AB</b>: Yeah, isn’t that awesome?<br/>\n<b>JB</b>: Yeah it is. I read in an article that you try to model your scoring game after Keishana Washington, who is obviously a Drexel legend. When she was here for her jersey retirement night, did you get to talk to her and can you talk about the impact she’s had on the program?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: Over the summer, we went to Ireland and she was at our games. Her being there helped feed me all the information she had gotten from Drexel, which I try to implement. It helped me a lot. She helped me stay patient and stay on course and I text her whenever I feel I’m in the wrong headspace and need advice. She’s always my go to, and she always texts me when I have a good game. Having her support has been awesome and having someone to look up to and seeing what she did with the program is something I want to repeat. I definitely appreciate her. <br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>JB</b>: If you could send one message to the Drexel fans as conference play continues to heat up, what would that be?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: Stay with us. It’s still early, I mean we still have two months left. Trust the process, because it’s not over yet and anything can happen. So, as long as we stay together we are going to be in great hands.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>JB</b>: So looking forward, you have multiple years of eligibility remaining, where do you see the future of this program and what personal goals do you have for yourself?<br/>\n<b>AB</b>: I see this program having well-rounded players and having awesome coaches who I trust very very much. They know what they’re talking about so we just need to stay on course, stay level-headed, and listen to them. I know this program is always going to be really fun, especially with the new recruits coming in, who I’m super excited for. I am definitely looking forward to a conference title, getting to March Madness and staying as one, you know, five as one as Coach Belle [Koclanes] always says in practice. So as long as we do that we will be great. For individual goals, I just want to be better than what I was yesterday, just being 1% better each day, trusting the process, trusting myself, trusting my coaches and teammates and I want to see where it takes me.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<b>JB</b>: Thank you so much Amaris, have a great rest of your season!</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>After the 9/11 terror attacks that killed nearly 3000 people, there was a surge in purchases of American flags. People wanted to show their support and solidarity for the United States during one of its darkest hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They purchased and flew Old Glory because of the flag’s status as the symbol of America. Since then, flags have continued to grow in popularity as a way for people to show support for social causes. Some of the most common flags we now see are the Gadsden flag (Don't Tread on Me), the LGBT+ pride flag and the POW/MIA flag. Flags hold deeper meaning in modern American society than they did even just 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trump supporters fly flags stating, \"Let's Go, Brandon,\" as a way of showing their support for the former president. Racists fly the Confederate battle flag thinking that it represents their heritage, even though the Confederacy lasted for about as long as it takes to complete a bachelor's degree. Flags are also sometimes flown to show solidarity, as has been the case for Ukraine. We do not live in Ukraine, but a lot of people fly the blue and yellow flag to show that America stands with them.</p>\n<p>With the evolving importance of flags in modern American culture, it makes sense that state flags have begun to adjust themselves to fit modern times. Mississippi had the last state flag in the country that incorporated the Confederate battle flag in its design. Its new flag is beautiful and perfectly represents the beauty of the great state of Mississippi. The changing of the flag was a step in the right direction for a state that has always dealt with difficult race relations. It was a sign of progress and a move towards equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Utah followed suit by designing a flag that perfectly represents the stunning landscapes unique to Utah. These sorts of designs are perfect for marketing and can increase tourism. Minnesota will be adopting its new flag on Statehood Day later this year thanks to a successful push to ditch its old racially insensitive flag. Minnesota will also be getting a new state seal. Both symbols are better representations of the modern state of Minnesota, which is important. Things always change as time moves on, and it is important for states to keep up with the times.</p>\n<p>The United States flag was most recently updated in 1960 after Hawaii became a state. If new states are added, like Puerto Rico, for example, it is likely that the American flag will be updated again. Shockingly, many states still have flags older than the national flag. For that reason, it makes sense that other states not previously mentioned should also consider updating the designs of their flags. The current flag of Pennsylvania was adopted in 1907. This was before World War 1 and before women had the right to vote. It makes sense that now would be a good time to update the state flag with something more modern and more marketable, something that Pennsylvanians can be proud to fly in their front yards or see in government buildings. Last summer, Representative Joe Webster proposed a bill that would begin the process of updating Pennsylvania's flag. While it may still be a while before Pennsylvania has enough support among elected officials to make a new flag design a reality, you can still do your part by contacting your state representative. <u>Let them know that you support redesigning Pennsylvania’s state flag</u>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/\"><u>https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/</u></a></p>",

More snow and ice followed on Tuesday, Jan. 16, and Friday, Jan. 19, which <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/weather/philadelphia-snow-totals-weather-forecast-winter-storm-20240119.html\"><u>the Philadelphia Inquirer</u></a> described as the closest thing we have had to \"an old-fashioned\" snowfall in two years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://6abc.com/weather-philadelphia-snow-drought-how-much-pa/14326149/#:~:text=January%2029%2C%202022%2C%20was%20the,the%20longest%20streak%20on%20record\"><u>ABC News</u></a>, this snowfall broke a 715-day drought with over 1 inch of snow, with the last time the city had over 1 inch of snow being on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>Drexel University's operations felt the effects of this sudden snowfall. After the first powdering of snow on the evening of Jan. 15, Drexel released a university-wide email on Jan. 16 saying that due to the weather, all on-campus operations would be delayed until 10 a.m.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel again suspended certain services due to the larger snowfall on Friday, Jan. 19, such as the Drexel bus services, which did not resume until Sunday, Jan. 21.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several students expressed their delight at having snow after nearly two years of only a few snowflakes here and there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third year student Brandon Leibowitz reported that it \"has been annoying\" that Philadelphia doesn't get snow very often, so this rare occurrence of snow \"was great\" and \"very exciting.\"</p>\n<p>Many students had similar sentiments; fourth year student Yair Oppenheim feels snow \"slows everything down,\" and gives us an opportunity to \"pause\" and \"live a little more,\" appreciating what usually gets lost in the hectic day-to-day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>International students also had positive reactions to the snow. Second year student Eden Sutton, expressed that she thinks that \"there's something magical about snow,\" especially for international students who come from \"very warm, desert-y places.\"</p>\n<p>Another second year international student, Nassar Otmani, felt that the snow brings \"a feeling of calm and tranquility,\" which gives people a moment to slow down.</p>\n<p>Otmani also said it is great to see communities \"come together\" to enjoy winter activities, like student snowball fights and snowman building.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even though many students enjoyed the snow, it also presented some challenges, particularly regarding mobility and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sutton described some disappointment with how Philadelphia handled the snow and felt they did not do \"the best of jobs\" in clearing its streets of ice or putting down salt before the snowfall.</p>\n<p>\"As a foreigner, no one really tells you how to deal with it yourself,\" Sutton expressed. She continued to explain that while the snow looked pretty one day, \"you find yourself walking on ice and probably getting hurt the next.\"</p>\n<p>The regular challenges of acclimating to different climates and all that comes with snow were only heightened by the ice sheet covering campus on Jan. 16.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second year student Yael Passy, described that she loves snow, and being from the south, she doesn't get to see it so often, making it an exciting, \"very fun\" opportunity; she also noted the difficulties that come with it.</p>\n<p>Passy felt that after the roads and sidewalks got icy following the first snow: \"No one was lifting up the ice, so it was a little dangerous on campus.\"</p>\n<p>She further described how \"Drexel did a great job for the second snow,\" but that the university seemed \"a little unprepared\" for the first snowfall and that campus \"felt a little dangerous\" the first few days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other students had similar experiences; for example, third year student Gavi Spellman was happy about the snow and said that it was \"nice\" to see the snow \"for the first time in a couple of years on campus.\"</p>\n<p>However, Spellman also felt that it was \"kind of icy out\" and that there wasn't enough salting at the beginning, which made the roads and sidewalks slippery.</p>\n<p>Spellman described that he felt that Drexel corrected it later on and put more salt out, which made the campus \"a little safer, which was nice,\" but that it was \"a little bit difficult at first,\" citing that he even \"slipped a couple of times.\"</p>\n<p>Along with the general disappointment with how Drexel handled the snow in terms of clearing the streets and sidewalks, some students expressed disappointment at how some Drexel departments dealt with absences due to the snow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The snow and icy sidewalks made it difficult for some students, especially commuters, to make it to class.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First year commuter student Pha Punsuk, was unable to make it to classes due to the snow but, per Drexel's policy, was not granted an excused absence, which she was \"disappointed\" about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The snow itself, combined with Drexel suspending buses on the days it snowed, made it much more difficult for commuters to make it to classes. Those who braved the cold and perilous icy sidewalks often fell on their way to classes, with reports of such incidents commonplace on Tuesday and Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, even with the icy-cold conditions, students still enjoyed the snow. From snowball fights to making snow cream, building snowmen, or even sledding down the hill by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Drexel students still found ways to make the most of this increasingly rare opportunity.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Triangle sat together with Michael Rankin, the director of Drexel’s Strength and Conditioning, and talked about what the program is about, his long time being at Drexel, and his experience working with an NFL team.</p>\n<p><b>Raphael Bartell: You are the Director of the Strength and Conditioning program here at Drexel. What does your daily work at Drexel look like?</b></p>\n<p>Michael Rankin: My direct work has changed over the years. When I started here it was only me and the GA (graduate assistant). I was in the gym pretty much all of the time. I used to see all of the athletes here. As I’ve been here longer we had a larger staff. Right now we have 6 people here including myself. Overall I would say that there is a lot of scheduling involved in what I do. There is a lot of management from the programming making sure that everything that we can squeeze in is squeezed in. I think if we are prepared for the athletes we can give them a better product and more attention. The more attention we can give our athletes the more they can realize what is the right way to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: You have been here at Drexel since 2002. What has changed over the 22 years you have been here?&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>MR: The weight room, as it is right now, didn’t exist when I started here. We had a much smaller area for our athletes. When we were able to build a new gym area we got more space for our athletes. One of the biggest additions was having a place to warm up. To be able to assess how people are feeling and moving is a really important part of our work here. We also made the changes to a free weight based program which we have now. Before that we used to train with machines. I think that we have all the resources now to be able to move forward. I don't think there is anything that we can’t meet whatever level student athletes come in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: What are some key elements a Division 1 athlete needs in order to to get the most out of their athletic practice?</b></p>\n<p>MR: For me there are really four key elements. First, I want to make sure that we touch on something mindset wise. I think you have to be really strong with how you're thinking when coming into the gym. A phrase people here always hear me say is: “Is what you're thinking helping you or hurting you?” Because challenges will always be a part of your life, whether it will be in the weight room, on the field, on the court, in your work, in the classroom or in your social life.</p>\n<p>The second would be fueling. We are really lucky to have a sports dietician in Andrea Irvine on our staff to be able to fill in with questions like: “Hey, what's the best type of fuel to put in so I can perform.” If you are fueled properly then you should be able to perform in all aspects of your daily life. And having so many options to choose from in the city or on campus can be overwhelming. But having some kind of guidelines can be really helpful for our athletes. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>The third key aspect is movement, being able to assess how you are moving. Is it moving well and how can you basically progress that and make it feel better, stronger, and faster.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fourth one is recovery. The most important aspect of recovery is sleep. Everything in between seven and nine hours is ideal. But you should still listen to your body and look at what you are needing and how you are feeling, so you can make adjustments. A lot of the other things get rolled in like doing ice baths, and fueling your body correctly, especially hydration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: A lot of pro athletes praise that lifting would prevent them from suffering injuries, would you agree?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I don’t think that we can prevent injuries. I think we can reduce the occurrence with good overall training. It comes down to the four key elements we have talked about before. &nbsp;So if I’m at a really bad place up top I don’t think that I can really go forward. If I’m not fueling properly, if I’m not recovering properly and if I’m not moving properly, well, these can all contribute to a higher occurrence of injuries. It is all connected. How often do people get hurt and they didn’t sleep well for a couple of days, or they were highly stressed for a few days which threw them all off. Those things all come together and I think we need to have a program that puts us in the right place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: In 2013 you had an internship for the NFL team, Cleveland Browns. How was this experience and what did you bring back to Drexel from this opportunity?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I loved it! I was very fortunate to be able to go out and work with a sport that I don’t get to work with here but played (Western Maryland College). It was like being around superheroes. When the helmet went on I can remember just feeling this overwhelming feeling of happiness, because it just seemed to be so cool to me. The camp was a big realization for my work here at Drexel. Wow, I get to work with almost like comic book heroes every day. Because the number of people who have the abilities that Division 1 student athletes have is actually very rare. It doesn’t seem that way but the overall population can’t do the things that the kids here on this campus and across the country can do. They are not only students but they have to do study hall or homework, practices, meetings, strength and conditioning, and they have their social life. There is a lot on their plate. It’s pretty special and I don’t know if we realize that as often as we probably should. It’s a pinch me moment when you realize that you kind of have some superpowers. But man it’s so cool to be able to come in here!</p>\n<p><b>RB: Fitness is currently one of the most hyped trends on the internet. On social media you can see countless influencers that are defined and have huge muscles. Is this something that concerns you?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I don’t get too concerned with things that I can’t really control. And social media is not something that I can control. Gaining an immense amount of muscles takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It’s not easy and it doesn’t happen overnight. I don’t want to broadly say don’t look at things online, because I think that there is some valuable information out there. But you have to be able to filter out what is useful and what isn’t. And I think you have to be careful too with understanding that not everything you see on social media is real. It is just made for that to entertain you. It’s not real life.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>RB: Would you say that there is a way to gain a lot of muscles in a short period of time?</b></p>\n<p>MR: In a short period of time typically raises caution flags for me. Strength and muscle gains come in small increments. You have to try to get one percent better each day. And if you do that consistently I think that you can do amazing things. But it really takes a long time. I think it can be done but you have to put in the right amount of fuel, the right amount of recovery and the right amount of work. And you gotta do that for a long time, knowing that it is small gains. If you see somebody get huge overnight, ask questions.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Part of being a student is struggling with the escalating costs of education. Whether it is tuition or textbooks, the financial burden might sometimes feel overwhelming. However, one expense that seems to be overlooked, yet often hurts our pockets, is the mandatory purchase of homework software and apps.</p>\n<p>In recent years, it has become increasingly common for various departments and classes at Drexel to make it compulsory for students to purchase specific homework software platforms such as Pearson, Zybooks, WileyPLUS, and Cengage. While these tools are marketed as essential for improving the learning experience, offering interactive assignments and immediate feedback, their high costs — often about $100 per subscription or more - add yet another expense to our already tight finances.</p>\n<p>What's especially concerning is the lack of clarity about who is making these decisions. Are these mandates coming from individual professors or the department? Students are frequently left in the dark as to why a particular software or app is considered important or mandatory for their course. Is it truly improving our learning experience, or is it merely an attempt for the department to increase revenue?</p>\n<p>Here are just a few examples from students around campus of amounts they have paid for mandatory homework software and the corresponding classes:</p>\n<p>Cengage: $133.27 for ECON 201</p>\n<p>McGraw Hill: $120 for BUSN 101</p>\n<p>WileyPLUS: $140.69 for PHYS 152-154</p>\n<p>Pearson: $118.79 for ENVS 260, $91.80 for MATH 101, $140 for PHYS 101, $113 for MATH 171, $132.49 for PHYS 101</p>\n<p>Zybooks: $64 for ENGR 131, $81.62 for CS 171, $56.71 for CS 172</p>\n<p>AKTIV Learning: $25-$45 for CHEM 101 and 102</p>\n<p>Lab Investigations Manual: $84 for PHEV -146</p>\n<p>These examples show the significant financial burden imposed on students by mandatory homework software purchases across various majors and departments.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the question of accessibility cannot be ignored. Not all students can afford these costly software licenses, leading to inequality in resource availability. As a result, several students in the past had no choice but to drop classes causing major setbacks to their plan of study and academic journey. This contradicts the values of equity and inclusion that Drexel strives to uphold.</p>\n<p>As the bills pile up, it is becoming evident that the existing approach is not working in the best interest of students. I believe it is time for an open and valuable discussion about the decisions driving the mandatory software purchases. It is also crucial that both departments and professors should explore alternative options and be transparent about their reasoning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the end, I do wonder who are these homework software benefitting- is it the students, faculty or university publisher tie-ups?</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Hitting theatres on Dec. 22, 2023, “Anyone But You,” is a new romantic comedy that has taken social media by storm. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The film’s plot is based on William Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” and throughout the film, there are nods to famous lines and plot points from the play. It all starts when Bea (Sydney Sweeney) — a carefree, quirky, but struggling law student — instantly hits it off with powerful, sarcastic-but-vulnerable finance clerk Ben (Glen Powell). After a brief falling out, the two reconnect months later during the wedding of Bea’s sister, Halle (Hadley Robinson) and Ben’s best friend, Claudia (Alexandra Shipp). Bea and Ben spend most of the duration of the movie pretending to be together to both ensure the happiness of the wedding party and to create envy in their respective exes, Jonathan (Darren Barnet), and Margaret (Charlee Fraser), who surprisingly show up in Australia for the ceremony. Of course, there are several obstacles in the couple’s way, which make faking a relationship difficult, but in the end, the two fall for each other in a not-so-fake way. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the film played very well in the rom-com genre. While there were certainly a few scenes trending toward the more passionate/intimate end, what made the movie enjoyable was the heavy amount of comedic relief offered. Some of the classic movies thought of in this genre focus too heavily on the relationship between leading characters and not so much on the light-hearted entertainment that makes viewers smile and laugh. “Anyone But You” was an incredible example of how humor could turn what would otherwise be “cheesy,” “corny” or “predictable” (terms heard all too often when speaking of similar movies) into a satisfying tale that celebrates love. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aside from including this wonderful balance, “Anyone But You” displayed wonderfully made costumes and beautiful scenery. Because it was filmed in Sydney, Australia, watchers get gorgeous views of crystal blue waters, breathtaking mountains and even a few encounters with the unique creatures that can be found down under. The costumes added to the magic, as designers made wonderful (and realistic) choices that perfectly matched each character’s personality. Sweeney in particular can often be envied for the glamorous dresses and fashionable everyday wear she sports throughout the movie. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, “Anyone But You” showcased a talented cast and offered a refreshing new take on the rom-com. Chemistry and comedy combine to make this film a truly special adaptation of the Shakespeare original that makes the notion of finding love all the more believable.&nbsp;</p>",

Its location makes it a prime spot for students to stop by on their way to the center of campus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Opening up on Drexel’s campus has been an experiment since we’ve mainly been functioning in mall locations up until this point,” said District Manager Angel Khanna. “This is one of the first street-side locations and it has been really successful so far. We’re looking forward to potentially expanding to other college campuses sometime in the future.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auntie Anne’s/Cinnabon/Carvel focuses on stellar customer service, cleanliness in the workspace and having fresh and quality products for everyone to enjoy, according to Khanna.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The [Auntie Anne’s/Cinnabon/Carvel] has more of a variety of options on the menu, and it’s a good addition to the rest of the locations on campus because of the quality of the food,” said Shaniya Gohel, a student that currently lives on campus. \"I find myself going in between classes often because of how close it is.”</p>\n<p>“Every time I go in, there’s always a lot of people,” said Basil Roy, a student who currently commutes to campus. “When I first came to the United States two years ago, Auntie Anne’s was the first place I stopped to get a snack from so it’s really cool that it’s spreading to more types of locations. There are definitely a lot of good places to eat on campus, but not a lot where you can buy sweet snacks at a reasonable price.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve been up and running for about a month, training new employees as we pick up the pace, and everything has been running pretty smoothly,” said Khanna. “We hope to continue to help expand the campus food and snack scene for the rest of the term and years to come.”</p>\n<p>Hours of operation are 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday.&nbsp;</p>",

But the Dragons fell flat in both games, sliding down the standings and making evident the glaring weaknesses that exist on this roster.</p>\n<p>In their first game, in which they hosted Monmouth in The DAC, the Dragons had a 4-1 conference record. While they had not taken on a top-ranked team yet, there seemed to be some momentum behind Amy Mallon’s squad and there was some hope that the team could keep rolling against the then 2-2 Hawks, the same team that unceremoniously knocked Drexel out of the CAA tournament last year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The game was largely a back-and-forth contest, and Drexel entered the fourth quarter down just two points. However, the Dragons ended up giving the game away to the Hawks in the final minutes to lose by a score of 63 to 55, and the dominant factor of the game was Monmouth’s ability to score the basketball while Drexel’s season-long offensive malaise continued.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Amy Mallon got a massive contribution from Amaris Baker, who erupted for 21 points, the rest of her squad was either ineffective, underutilized, or invisible. Brooke Mullins and Chloe Hodges each scored nine points on a combined 7-27 shooting performance. Freshman Laine McGurk was a bright spot as she contributed eight points on 3-7 shooting, but was only on the court for fourteen minutes. Grace O’Neil played all but four minutes in this contest, but only shot the ball one time and finished the game with no points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Drexel took a trip up to Stony Brook to take on the first-place Seawolves, there was some hope that Amy Mallon and her staff would be able to scheme a way to stifle their opponent’s offense. The Seawolves score an average of 76 points per game, a whopping 20 points more than Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In good news, The Dragons held Stony Brook to just 62 points. In bad news, the Drexel offense went from ugly to ice cold. In the first quarter, the Dragons held Stony Brook to just 14 points, which would have been a great sign had Drexel not scored zero points in the opening ten minutes of the game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the first quarter on, the game was essentially over. Drexel shot 24% from the floor, 15% from beyond the arc, and gave up 15 points off of turnovers. Brooke Mullins shot a brutal 1-15 from the floor and Laine McGurk was unable to infuse any meaningful offense into the Dragons as she shot 3-10.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, these two losses are emblematic of Drexel’s greater issue, and that is their lack of scoring threats. Brooke Mullins is the team’s most skilled player, and while she certainly puts up shots, many of them are heavily contested and ill-advised. The reason opposing defenses can guard her so closely is because there are few other players on the team besides McGurk who can create their own shot and be an offensive threat.</p>\n<p>If Amy Mallon continues to not be able to find ways to create a more evenly distributed scoring effort from her team, the Dragons look like they will continue along as they have been, beating up on the bottom tier teams of the CAA and getting beaten up by the top squads in the conference.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Drexel Dragons defeated the NC A&amp;T Aggies to improve to 8-1 in the CAA conference. This was the second matchup between the two sides as earlier in the month, the Dragons narrowly scrapped out a 67-63 victory in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>The Dragons controlled the game in every aspect. Besides an early three-pointer from the Aggies, Drexel maintained a lead for most of the game and never let the Aggies within arm's reach of them. One of the key factors of their success is their exceptional ability to rebound the ball. They won the rebounding battle 47-34, including 13 offensive boards that led to 11 second chance points. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“You can’t win a championship, you can’t win a ring without rebounds. We need to be a good rebounding team,” said Drexel head coach Zach Spiker. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forward Lucas Monroe had eight rebounds while Lamar Oden Jr. had nine as he returned to the squad from injury. Monroe also had seven points as he certainly established himself within Drexel’s starting lineup. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another key part of Drexel’s success is the depth of their bench. The Dragon’s bench combined for 34 points whilst the Aggies' only managed 8. Redshirt freshman Shane Blakeney made an immediate impact off the bench and scored a career-high 12 points. He scored three three-pointers and a layup that also got called for a foul. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other members like Jamie Bergens and Yame Butler can successfully fill in for the starters when they need a rest, whilst junior forward Garfield Turner can take over in Amari William’s absence. Turner had nine rebounds with four of them being offensive. Turner also had two of Drexel’s six blocks. Bergens and Butler combined for 12 points off the bench. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a lot of guys which means you’ve got a lot of combinations, and we got to continue to make sure we got the right people out there that complement each other. We still need to continue to make sure we’re putting the right guys in the right situations,” said Spiker regarding his bench’s depth. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s rotation of players can keep players fresh and eliminates the need for their starters to play 30-plus minutes every game like other collegiate programs. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It’s nice when you get subbed out and they bring someone in and there’s no drop-off. We have the CAA Preseason Player of the Year (Amari Williams) and we even sub him out. Everyone trusts each other when they’re on the court. It’s awesome, it takes a lot of stress off,” said Monroe. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spiker also credits the team’s success to their team’s bond on and off the court as well as Lucas Monroe’s impact in the locker room. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a fun group, we got a group that creates a lot of smiles and that’s awesome, but maybe time and place we need to be locked in. I think our guys respect him because Lucas puts the work in, and I think when you do that it’s easy for guys to respect you,” said Spiker. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heading into the back half of the season Drexel has been in talks of multiple March Madness brackets as the 13th or 14th seed. They are currently leading the CAA conference and are favorites to win it. Drexel has a two-win cushion over both 6-2 Charleston and UNCW but needs to finish strong and clinch the #1 seed of the CAA conference tournament. They head to New Jersey to face off against Monmouth University.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>As the volume of commitments increases and the May 15 signing deadline crawls closer, Drexel men’s basketball team has signed a player who could make a big impact in the near future. Clemson Edomwonyin is a big 6’10” forward from East London, England, who has a unique basketball background, making him a fascinating prospect to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edomwonyin has a rather unorthodox story of how he elevated to basketball excellence, as he first started playing basketball in the fall of 2020. He began his career at the City of London Academy, gaining initial attention for his incredible speed and athleticism as a forward. Edomwonyin follows a trend of Drexel recruits with British backgrounds, as both big man Amari Williams and sharp shooter Mate Okros played high school basketball in England.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In the UK, there’s a lot of underrated players that go undiscovered,” Clemson mentioned, “there are some unexpected people with big talent, and you kind of just go, damn this guy is good.”</p>\n<p>Although Drexel was his first Division 1 offer, it was not his only, as A-10 school Fordham also extended an offer to Edomwonyin. When I talked with Clemson, he made it clear the reason why he chose to be a Dragon in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The coaching staff was the primary reason,” he asserted. “Speaking with Spiker and all the other coaches gave me a lot of confidence.” Clemson added that his coaches in the U.K. were in full support of his decision, and admired Drexel’s track record of developing big men.</p>\n<p>On top of the coaching staff, Edomwonyin gave credit to Amari Williams, a fellow British forward, for helping assure him of his decision. “I was able to speak with Amari on my visit, and we got along well. He talked about how he used to play, and how the coaches helped him develop,” Clemson recounted. “It helped me picture the vision of playing at Drexel.”</p>\n<p>Following his time in London, Edomwonyin transferred to the South Kent School in Connecticut, an incredibly well established prep basketball program that has produced over 100 NCAA division 1 basketball players and 10 NBA players, including former NBA all-star Isaiah Thomas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adding to his impressive resume of high caliber basketball and rapid development, Clemson played with the U18 Spanish National team, where he followed in both Williams' and Okros' path playing at the Hoopsfix showcase. Clemson showed appreciation for what playing in Spain had done for his growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Early on I recognized I had to improve to compete with the tough competition,” Clemson stated. “I feel like [playing in Spain] gave me a lot of confidence in what I can do, and will help me translate my speed and athleticism to playing at Drexel.”</p>\n<p>It’s clear Clemson Edomwonyin is an incredibly talented basketball player with a lot of passion for the game, as well as a passion for the fans. When asked about what he was looking forward to about playing in Philadelphia he talked about the people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard the people in Philly are good fans, and I want to win for them.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, the talk of Philadelphia may have brought up the recruit’s appetite, as he expressed his excitement for trying Philly Cheesesteaks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clemson Edomwonyin joins Archbishop Wood’s Josh Reed as Drexel’s incoming freshmen for the 2024-25 season. Edomwonyin’s size paired with his athleticism could make him a big contributor, and his passion and personality should make him a fan favorite for the Dragons.&nbsp;</p>",

The partnership signifies both a financial boost for SEPTA and an increasing trend of institutional collaborations with public transit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Situated along SEPTA’s Market-Frankford line, the 30th Street subway station holds a pivotal role, <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/septa-30th-street-station-new-name-drexel-renovations/\"><u>described</u></a> as “a gateway to both Center City and University City.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The station also serves as an access point for trolley routes and bus services, making it a central hub in Philadelphia’s extensive public transportation network.</p>\n<p>The station has been undergoing renovations since 2020. Key improvements include the installation of a new head house, better elevators for enhanced accessibility, improved lighting and the implementation of advanced safety features. With these changes, SEPTA hopes to elevate the overall commuter experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paired with the neighboring Drexel Square, Drexel Station at 30th Street is set to welcome commuters to Schuylkill Yards. This district is a collaborative venture between Drexel University and Brandywine Realty Trust, embodying a 3.5 billion dollar investment that began with the opening of Drexel Square in 2019.</p>\n<p>Drexel University President John Fry <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2023/December/SEPTA-and-Drexel-Announce-Station-Naming-Rights-Agreement\">stated</a>, “We’re so proud to partner with SEPTA to put Drexel University's name on the station that serves as the gateway for so many of our students, faculty, professional staff, and community partners as they arrive on campus. As new educational, research, and business development opportunities continue to grow in West Philadelphia - it is fitting for Drexel to welcome everyone to University City.”</p>\n<p>The new and improved station is expected to be officially unveiled with a ribbon-cutting ceremony this year.</p>",

We have always been competitive but have had an increase in success over the last few seasons.”</p>\n<p>DUST recently competed at Belleayre Mountain last weekend and will be traveling for their fourth competition of the season this upcoming weekend to Camelback Mountain in Tannersville, PA.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>As we reach February, we are one step closer to Spring. However, while it might take a few more months for the weather to warm up, Drexel’s winter sports season has already heated up as Tennis, Squash, Wrestling and Basketball are all entering the thick of their respective seasons. While you may not have been following each sport closely, The Triangle is here to get you up to speed with what's been happening on the various courts.</p>\n<p><b>Women’s Squash:</b></p>\n<p>Currently ranked 10th in the nation with a record of four wins and five losses, the Women’s Squash team has not been able to exactly replicate their success from the 2022-2023 season where they finished ranked fifth in the nation. The Dragons’ season featured four dominating wins this season, with their best win coming against the current 12th ranked team in the nation in Columbia University, and five losses, all against top-ten ranked teams. Even in the losses, however, the Dragons were in tight games, with three of their losses being decided by a score of five to four. On Feb. 9, Drexel will head to the Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference Championships to try and take home some hardware before heading back for more regular season play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Men’s Squash:</b></p>\n<p>Similar to the Women, the Men’s Squash team is experiencing a dip in the national rankings this season as they are presently ranked eighth in the nation after finishing last season at number five. Also similar to the Women, the Men have more or less taken care of business against teams ranked lower than them, while suffering defeats to teams ranked above them. The Dragons will look to earn some signature wins at the Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference Championships next week.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Women’s Tennis:</b></p>\n<p>While they have only officially participated in two matches, the Drexel Women’s Tennis team is off to a hot start as they have won matchups against Lehigh and Rider by scores of 7-0 and 6-1 respectively. Additionally, Drexel’s number one player Lorie Lemongo, a Junior from Yaounde, Cameroon, was named CAA player of the week on Jan. 30. The Dragons will look to keep up their momentum as they meet Mt. Saint Mary’s and Delaware State on Feb. 2 and 4, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Men’s Tennis:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>In their first two team matches of the season, the Dragons are a dominant 2-0. Across their victories over Villanova and Mt. Saint Mary’s, Drexel has dropped just one single match. While the team’s success has been a complete effort, the Dragons are led by Alan Jesudason, the team’s number one singles player, and his doubles partner Alex De Sousa. Together, De Sousa and Jesudason were named the CAA Doubles Team of the Week. Drexel will look to stay undefeated as they head up to Long Island and take on the Hofstra Pride on Feb. 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Wrestling:</b></p>\n<p>In a season that is shaping up to be one to forget, Drexel Wrestling is currently 2-8 in all matches and 1-3 in conference play. &nbsp;While their victories have been hard to come by for the Dragons, they were able to take down Princeton for their first EIWA win of the year. After being one of the six Dragons to win a bout against Princeton, Sophomore Jordan Soriano captured a win over the nation’s 28th-ranked wrestler, Jason Miranda, in Drexel’s loss to 20th-ranked Stanford.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Drexel Dragons welcomed the Delaware Fighting Blue Hens to a packed Daskalakis Athletic Center of 2,461 attendees. A fierce CAA rival and the full capacity stadium during homecoming weekend were sure to create a buzzing crowd atmosphere. The Dragons had defeated Monmouth 78-74 a few days before and hoped to continue their dominant form in CAA conference play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was the first game that the DAC sold out since they played Temple in mid-November of last year. That game was Drexel’s debut in the Philadelphia Big 5 as well as their home opener.</p>\n<p>Drexel came out of the gates strong, with a 12-4 lead in the first four minutes of the game. Justin Moore had an assist and five minutes in the opening two minutes, while Amari Williams had two assists and a block that was met by cheers from the Drexel fans.</p>\n<p>However, Delaware wouldn’t let the Dragons establish a lead. The Blue Hens regrouped during the TV timeout and clawed their way back to take a three-point lead midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the half went back and forth between the two sides. Luke House’s turnaround jumper reestablished a six point Drexel lead. House had four points in the first half.</p>\n<p>But a second chance putback from Delaware would level the scores as the halftime buzzer sounded. Drexel and Delaware walked into their locker rooms tied at 34-34 and nothing to separate the two. The Dragons led by five with three and a half minutes remaining but missed their final five shots and allowed Delaware to come back.</p>\n<p>The second half was all Drexel as they established a lead that Delaware wasn’t able to come back from. Mate Okros’ two three pointers got the DAC roaring in cheers and a Lucas Monroe jump shot gave the Dragons an eight point lead that forced a Delaware timeout.</p>\n<p>With less than three minutes remaining, Justin Moore found an open lane, drove in, and slammed a two-handed dunk that ignited another cheer from the crowd. With ten seconds left and the victory surely in Drexel’s hands, Lucas Monroe flew in from the point and slammed a dunk of his own to ice the game, running back to the Drexel student section with outstretched arms, blowing kisses to the crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t going to dunk it, but the lane opened and I saw the basket and I knew the crowd would love it so I just did it,” said Lucas Monroe on his dunk late in the game.</p>\n<p>Monroe played a well-rounded game, scoring a career-high 14 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. He also shot an efficient 7-9 from the field.</p>\n<p>“I feel more comfortable on the court now just from playing more, but I’ve never been a big-time scorer. I’ve scored 14 points before, never been able to get past it, but I can bring a lot of other things like rebounding and defending,” said Monroe, reflecting on his performance.</p>\n<p>Triple zeros ended the match where the Dragons finished with a 19 point lead over the Blue Hens. Drexel scored 52 points in the second half whilst Delaware could only muster up 33.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to have many fans at the game. Everyone’s really hyped, but we have a 1-0 mindset. So we were 1-0 today, tomorrow we’re 0-0,” said Monroe.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely exciting. The student section, fans, was a sold-out game, just think we’re even here right now. We were enjoying it while it lasts right now, but we know as soon as Monday hits we get back to practice it’s the only mindset,” said Amari Williams.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s dominance in the second half can be seen through the stat sheets. They shot 70.4% on 19-27 shooting and 60% from three on 6-10 shooting. Along with this Drexel had five players that scored double-digit points: Lucas Monroe, 14 points; Mate Okros, 12 points; Amari Williams, 14 points; Justin Moore, 18 points; and Kobe Magee;, 15 points. Together they scored 85% of Drexel’s points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’re just figuring it out. Knowing our roles, it takes the pressure off each other,” said Amari Williams.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the things about the team, is there’s times when some of the starters were sitting on the bench and I think that’s the beauty of this team. It’s nice to know when you know you have guys that are going to come in and there’s not going to be any dropoff,” added Monroe.</p>\n<p>The Dragons started the season 7-6 from their out-of-conference matchups, but since the Delaware game, Drexel is 5-0 from CAA conference play and sits comfortably atop the standings.</p>\n<p>“I think there’s a lot of belief and confidence in our locker room in each other and certainly from our staff to our players. You look at how we play now to how we played then, certainly, we’ve improved offensively and taking care of the basketball. The guys to their credit I thought they handled all that really well,” said Coach Spiker on the season so far.</p>\n<p>With the back half of the season to play and the upcoming CAA conference tournament on the horizon. Drexel has the potential to earn a bid into the NCAA tournament. As the leaders of the CAA conference, they hold their destiny as the season progresses forward.</p>",

Getting these styles done in a clean and efficient manner come with high costs and require preparing for mental challenges of individual braider’s “rules.” Plus, there is no guarantee you will find someone in close proximity. So what are Black Dragons meant to do? They can seek the help of Dilys Attram, the owner of Hair by Dilly.</p>\n<p>Attram is a first year communication student with a concentration in public relations, and a first-generation Ghanaian-American who was born and raised in the Poconos. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I had a point in my life where I thought I wanted to do political science but I don’t think that that was for me,\" Attram said. \"When I got here, I didn’t have a focus and I was leaning towards journalism but when I looked into public relations, I loved seeing people interact and I thought that was so cool. The meaning that people have when they talk? It’s so interesting. With PR, you have to figure out how to problem solve, how to see into the future. With PR, you have to learn how to effectively translate what people want<i> </i>to say.”</p>\n<p>The goal of figuring out what the audience is asking of her can also be reflected within her work. Attram does not want to leave clients feeling insecure about their hair. Not only is expression through hair such an important aspect of black culture, growing up as a black person means that your crown says a lot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If I can have a say, I want to make you feel good about yourself especially when you see your hair,” said Attram.</p>\n<p>Delving more into her services, Attram is more of a braider than a stylist. She does loc retwists, knotless braids, traditional box braids, french curls, two-strand twists, rope twists and is slowly making her way into doing cornrows and stitch braids. She is a very flexible braider, and as she is young, Attram understands how new styles pop up often. When she is not experienced with certain types, she will offer a discounted price and friendly disclaimer in order to make sure her clients are aware and comfortable with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Attram had originally started braiding during Covid-19 when salons were closed and she was forced to have a more hands-on approach to hair maintenance. She was always the type of person to try and fix loose braids so trying it out on her own from scratch was not as daunting to her as it would be for others. From doing her own hair, to practicing on her mother, friends and roommates, whom she gives all her credit and love to for supporting her through this journey, she eventually established herself and created a small side hustle while still understanding her clients' need for affordable pricing.</p>\n<p>When asked to describe her business, Attram says it is constantly evolving. Every step she has made has been a learning moment for herself both in the braiding world and in the PR world. With the direct contact she has with her target market, she is able to understand what the people are looking for and how to give it to them.</p>\n<p>To contact Attram, you can find her on Instagram @hair.by.dilly.</p>\n<p><i>This article is part of a column dedicated to supporting small businesses on Drexel University’s campus.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Drexel Muslim Students Association held a closed door town hall with senior university leadership on Jan. 25 to share the experiences of Palestinian and Muslim students on campus since the humanitarian crisis in Palestine began. The town hall took place from 5-7 p.m. in Stratton 113, with a Zoom option for those who could not attend in person.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s senior university leadership consisted of five panelists that sat at the front of the lecture hall. There were around 30 students in attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We are here for peace. We are here to understand,” stated Noor Jemy, DMSA’s faculty advisor.</p>\n<p>The panel consisted of Vice President of Public Safety Mel Singleton, Vice Provost for Diversity, Equality &amp; Inclusion Leslie Ashburn---Nardo, Associate Vice President of Student Health &amp; Wellness Dr. Annette Molyneux, Executive Director of Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging Shardé Johnson and Associate Vice President and Dean of Student Life Dr. Katie &nbsp;Zamulinsky. Drexel’s Senior Vice President Subir Sahu was also in attendance. Each of the panelists explained how their department’s services were there to support every student at Drexel.</p>\n<p>Many students recounted their experiences of feeling unsafe on Drexel’s campus in regards to the university’s lack of support for Palestinian and Muslim students. They expressed how their mental health has been negatively affected. Participants described how they live in fear and how some of them are afraid to show their religious association or heritage in public due to the risk of being targeted. Students also reported that they received calls from their parents and loved ones cautioning them not to attend events in support of Palestine, as they feared they would be harmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’ll speak up no matter what. I’ll keep on putting on my hijab everyday,” stated a freshman biomedical engineering major.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other students expressed how they still choose to wear their keffiyeh as a symbol of their Palestinian pride.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In reference to wearing a keffiyeh, a former Drexel student stated, “Don’t ever let that courage go away.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also spoke about their disappointment in the responses of Drexel professors and common sentiments about inappropriate comments that dismiss feelings of distress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The social chair of DMSA and third year biology major at Drexel stated that one of her professors told her, “I don’t believe that this is a genocide,” after asking what the DMSA town hall was about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A freshman biomedical engineering student added that one of her professors told her that she was, “Too ambitious to be whatever you want to be for who you are,” in reference to the fact that she is Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple students brought up emails from Drexel President John Fry that they felt were misrepresentative and biased towards Muslims and Palestinians. The treasurer of DMSA compared emails sent regarding the events of Oct. 7 to those regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that there was a lack of resources provided to students and a lack of acknowledgement of the deaths in Palestine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also expressed dismay with how Drexel Police handled security for the Palestine Teach-In hosted by Drexel Palestine Coalition in Gerri C. Lebow Hall on Jan. 25 from 12 p.m. onward. A sophomore middle education student asked Chief of Police Singleton, why public safety, Drexel Police and the Philadelphia Police surrounded the building both before and during the teach-in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students stated that the high police presence made it feel like “public safety was protecting the university from them [teach-in participants].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his response, Singleton indicated that Drexel Police were not provided with information regarding how many people would attend the teach-in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He stated that Drexel Police’s main priority was to “protect everyone.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the meeting, Singleton repeatedly stressed his request for students to communicate more with campus police in order to build trust and familiarity with their presence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel Palestine Coalition released a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C2nGt2gOwuZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"><u>statement</u></a> regarding the police presence at the teach-in on Jan. 27 identifying the police presence as “an act of police intimidation.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The statement continued, “We condemn the police response as a disproportionate action which inherently criminalizes Palestinian identity and Palestinian liberation. We will not permit the criminalization of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim identities on or off our campus.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The town hall wrapped around 7:25 p.m. with DMSA stating that they planned to extend the availability of the panelists for more questions in the future. Sahu and the panelists confirmed that conversations about the safety of Muslim and Palestinian students have been happening within Drexel admin and will increase following the meeting to address the student feedback given. A link was given for attendees to provide additional feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on DMSA, visit their page on <a href=\"https://drexel.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/drexel-muslim-students-association\"><u>DragonLink</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>",

It has been recurring and growing every year since, celebrating its 20th anniversary this past November.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We started with… just over 30 restaurants, and now, today, we have 118 in the program, with… the most we ever had in the 130s,” Giavana Suraci, the senior manager of retail marketing and events at CCD reports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a restaurant week lover herself, she recommends <a href=\"https://themorrisphilly.com\">The Morris</a>, a newly established neighborhood steakhouse, which she credits for having excellent vegetarian options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sara Chiaravalloti, Drexel University alumna and current team member of CCD, shared her experience with Restaurant Week during her time as an undergraduate: “It gives you an experience with friends, especially people that you go to class with. I remember usually doing it with the women in business at Lebow. There were a group of great girls that I met from [Restaurant Week], and we did it practically every fall.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chiaravalloti especially recommends these deals to students who are new to the area and are looking to meet people, explore Philadelphia cuisine and support local businesses, all at an affordable cost. Chiaravalloti suggests <a href=\"https://giuseppesons.com\">Giuseppi &amp; Sons</a> (Italian cuisine), <a href=\"https://www.forsythiaphilly.com\">Forsythia</a> (French cuisine) and <a href=\"https://www.misssaigonphilly.com\">Miss Saigon </a>(Vietnamese influenced cuisine).</p>\n<p>Cailey Ruderman, class of 2024 majoring in materials science and engineering, is a Restaurant Week frequenter and expressed, “Restaurant Week in Philadelphia is a great opportunity for me as a college student to access the high-end food scene in the city without breaking the bank. I’ve visited a number of different restaurants throughout the city over the years and I’m excited to try more!”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruderman also mentioned that these three-course, fixed-menu options give her the rare opportunity to enjoy dessert with her meal.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Allie Lenz, class of 2025, operations and supply chain management, recently enjoyed her first Restaurant Week experience this year: “It was such a great deal… It was $45… and I was with one other person. We ended up just splitting everything.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.ristorantelanonna.com\">La Nonna’s</a>, the staff lets guests share their three courses, allowing them to cut costs on the already reduced $45 per person fee, providing a favorable opportunity for students on a strict budget.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [Restaurant Week] comes up so fast, and then I don’t realize it’s happening. I love the Philly food scene, so I most definitely [would return] if I could remember when it was about to happen,” Lenz confessed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brianna Heidenreich, class of 2023 majoring in environmental science, added a unique perspective as a new Drexel graduate who stayed local to Philly after commencement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It gives us a reason to catch up [with friends] and see how everything is going post-grad.

            "body_html": "<p>In light of recent events, Liz Magill and Claudine Gay’s “alleged<i>”</i> ousting — or as they call them, “resignations” from their presidential roles at the University of Pennsylvania (Magill) and Harvard University (Gay) — it’s become apparent that aside from crypto and coding, knowing how to impeach a university president is an increasingly vital skill. After all, you never know when this information will come in handy. Though this seems comedic now, this article will prove its credibility when either party inevitably sues me for “slander,” “defamation” or any other grandiose yet ambiguous charge that has fairly little consequence: much like the actual role of any university president.</p>\n<p>Before you spend any more time reading this article, I advise you to rethink attempting a <s>coup</s>. Never mind, my editor said I can’t say that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attempt Two: attempting a “top-down restructuring of an educational institution” is not advised if you do not maintain the following prerequisites. These include but are not limited to: university faculty status – preferably a Ph.D. (or at the very least working in upper administration), general credibility amongst colleagues, reasonable cause (real or manufactured) and about one year to a decade of plotting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Typically overthrowing a university figurehead – sorry, “president” – involves (1) establishing cause. As listed under “prerequisites” you must have a reasonable cause for undermining your university administration. Though evidence does not have to be truthful, one must be able to prove it as though it is credible. This ties into (2) rallying the Troops. Once you have collected enough evidence you must sway your colleagues (preferably in upper administration) to your side. This portion is essentially workplace gossip designed to warrant mistrust of the president. Once you have sufficiently spilled the tea to the faculty, you must gauge how much support you have. This next step is what will make or break a coup. (3) At least two-thirds (this varies by the university) of the faculty senate must declare “no confidence” in the university president. Then the events will go as follows: the media will take wind of this story, your friends on the board of trustees will be talking, and then these same trustees will inevitably ask for the president's resignation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But honestly, all these steps feel like a lot of work so I will propose some easier ways to get rid of a university president. The easiest and most sane way to oust a president would be to do what they used to do to United States presidents back in the day – beware of convertibles if you catch my drift. If you’re an engineer might I suggest Elon Musking them into the sun? Though based on the fact Millennium Hall is sinking I would not suggest anyone here attempt this. Of course, I have saved the best for last, though this might land me on a watch list but hear me out: You could kidnap their firstborn child – [My editor said I can’t say this]. Hopefully, this helps inform your forthcoming plans as an agent of change, educational reformist, or future top-down--restructurer.</p>\n<p>With peace and love,</p>\n<p>Your Favorite Future Coup Leader ;)&nbsp;</p>",

You probably don't, but I’m going to tell you anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We seem to have a playlist for everything. When people are sad, they listen to their R&amp;B list, which ranges from \"Playing Games\" by Summer Walker to \"Sad, Beautiful, Tragic\" by Taylor Swift; &nbsp;it really depends on if you got left on read or dumped (which are kind of the same thing to those of us who live on Snapchat and haven’t been in an actual relationship). And of course &nbsp;there is the “I’m better” playlist which is filled with songs by The Weeknd and SZA. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When people are mad and want to scream, they listen to some rap and do twenty reps of god knows what in the gym… they think it’s their “gym era.” It’s not (They don’t go back until New Year’s, which only lasts for a week). And if they actually do stick with the gym grind, it starts off with songs from Drake’s newest album that they forced themselves to listen to, until they secretly go back to their 2010 throwback list. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When people are happy…well, I don’t even know…what do you do, pull out YouTube and type in “When you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands?” Yeah, you may be able to tell I’m a bit snippy right now… I’m currently listening to \"Never Lose Me\" by Flo Milli; I’m in my bad bleep/academic weapon era. Never mind the fact that my \"sad girl\" and \"I’m better\" &nbsp;playlists had been on repeat for the past two weeks… don’t ask me whether I got left on read or dumped. They’re basically the same thing ;)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you mad at my brutal honesty? Go play \"Niagara Falls\" by Metroboomin, Travis Scott and 21 Savage, then skip to 31 seconds. It’s a rap song, there’s a lot you can learn from me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>College kids, man, so predictable.&nbsp;</p>",

While the rest of the world grapples with serious matters, Punxsutawney's focus is squarely on Phil, the rotund rodent with an uncanny knack for weather predictions.</p>\n<p>As the sun rises over this quirky town, Phil emerges from his burrow to face the daunting task of forecasting the next six weeks of weather. The town holds its breath, creating a palpable atmosphere of anticipation — well, except for that one guy who seems more confused than a squirrel at a traffic intersection.</p>\n<p>Phil, the groundhog guru, is said to have a team of groundhog psychologists, weather experts, and a life coach named Gary, who specializes in motivating rodents. Phil's preparation involves hours of burrow meditation, sunbathing and a healthy dose of \"Groundhog Day\" reruns because nothing says \"preparation\" like Bill Murray's comedic time-loop shenanigans.</p>\n<p>In the days leading up to the grand prediction, Punxsutawney transforms into a Groundhog Day carnival. Street vendors peddle an array of \"Phil-tastic\" merchandise, from groundhog-shaped umbrellas to limited-edition shadow-themed sunglasses. The local diner even serves up a special dish called \"Six More Weeks of Winter Waffles,\" topped with an avalanche of whipped cream.</p>\n<p>Enter Gary, a rival groundhog attempting to cast a shadow over Phil's predictions by spreading rumors about his burrow antics. Gary claims Phil spends his winters binge-watching groundhog soap operas and refining his dance moves for an imaginary \"Groundhog's Got Talent.\"</p>\n<p>As the fateful morning arrives, the town is alive with excitement and anxiety. Will Phil cast a shadow, dooming us to endure six more weeks of winter? Or will he predict an early spring, giving us hope for flip-flop weather sooner rather than later?</p>\n<p>In a surprising twist, Phil announces, \"I've decided to take a gap year from weather predictions. Comedy is my calling!\" The crowd is left in stunned silence, unsure if Phil's announcement is part of a grand Groundhog conspiracy or just a mid-life crisis.</p>\n<p>Seizing the opportunity, Gary steps into the limelight, declaring himself the new weather prophet. Emerging from his burrow wearing a cape made of recycled weather reports, Gary confidently claims, \"I spotted my shadow and a shooting star — brace yourselves for six weeks of meteor showers, folks!\"</p>\n<p>And so, the chaos unfolds in Punxsutawney as residents grapple with the uncertainty of their weather future. One thing is certain — whether it is six more weeks of winter or an impending groundhog uprising, Punxsutawney Groundhog Day will always be a legendary blend of laughter, absurdity and a touch of weather whimsy.</p>",

The obvious answers might be the anxiety about getting a job, the fear of rejection, the fact that your interviews always align with finals or realizing you were broke after engaging in some retail therapy.

If you want to know where Drexel’s priorities lie, look no further than the payment portal. A portal so clean and slick that it would make the TikTok girlies jealous. It's clear who the favorite child is, and it is not the one they brag about to all the relatives at Thanksgiving. It's simple really: we use the pretty payment portal, Drexel gets our money, and they spend it on [checks notes] a SEPTA station. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The craziest part about this is the fact we have an entire major dedicated to user experience and interaction design. Why can’t we use one of them to fix our co-op portal? It could be their senior project, or better yet, make it a co-op.

            "body_html": "<p>eRay Ban and Meta announced a partnership last year to sell high quality smart glasses. The glasses include two cameras and allow the user to record videos and take pictures discreetly. This idea is a &nbsp;nightmarish development in the expanding invasion of privacy that is quickly taking over our lives. As TikTok has become more popular the quest for likes has resulted in people recording every simple interaction they can in the hopes of getting that sweet validation so many desperately crave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of living in the moment and enjoying the goofy company of close friends, every word or action now needs to be carefully self-monitored to prevent yourself from becoming a viral laughingstock. Every mistake a person makes, joke a person tells, or awkward moment someone has is now at risk of being blasted over the internet for millions to see. The mistakes of our past are doomed to haunt us as self-righteous observers pick up their pitchforks to attack those they deem immoral after watching a 30 second TikTok video. Just as frustrating are the secret recordings of people who do not realize they are being made fun of for the entertainment of strangers.</p>\n<p>It is a universal truth that everyone has said something they wish they didn’t say or done something they wish they did not do. In the past, these moments could be easily forgotten. Now, it seems as though even the most mundane activities need to be choreographed and filmed like we are all actors in an episode of \"Girls\" The ability to create narratives from short clips has allowed people to villainize others they don’t like. One famous example of this is the video recording of Douglas Levison yelling at a trumpet player in New York City. Levison has said in interviews after the incident that he was frustrated with the noisy trumpet player for almost hitting him with his bike. Levison’s reaction was certainly overkill, but the mountain of insults calling him ugly, short and a goblin were equally uncalled for because no one knew what happened before the camera was recording. Levison went on to lampoon himself in the film Heaven Knows What, demonstrating he at least has a sense of humor about the incident.</p>\n<p>In some cases, recording people is no doubt a good thing. During the 2020 murder of George Floyd a cell phone recording provided the critical evidence needed to convict police officer Derek Chauvin and send him to prison. This is one of the greatest examples of when recording something yields positive results – in this case, the conviction of a murderer. Technological advancements, including more abundant cameras, do have the potential to improve our lives when it comes to crime prevention. Video evidence can assist in proving or disproving guilt in the case of serious crimes. That being said, convicting someone who committed a crime is very different from recording your wannabe comedian friend doing an insensitive standup routine. Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and others are now holding piles of dirt on people that have in many cases been used to destroy the lives of good people. The same people who cast the heaviest judgment upon those who they deem immoral or wrong are in reality just waiting their turn to sit in the same exact hot seat. We have all gotten upset at someone and overreacted or said something awkward. That is why there are so many memes that literally joke about this very fact.</p>\n<p>Think before you pull out your phone. Ask yourself this important question, “will anyone care about this as much as I do?” If the answer is not an enthusiastic “yes” then do yourself and others a favor. Stop recording every moment you have and posting it on the internet. You may not realize it now, but we do not yet live in a world that forgives the common mistakes of people. Save the camera for truly important moments because we live in a world that is constantly looking for the next person to hate and using social media to find them. This reality is unfortunately very dangerous for our futures.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Every year, billions of people commit themselves to New Year’s Resolutions. With the new year came a new slate for Drexel’s Basketball teams, and I took the responsibility upon myself to make some of the Dragons’ lives easier by coming up with their resolutions for them.</p>\n<p><b>Mate Okros: Make some history</b></p>\n<p>When I sat down to interview Coach Zack Spiker right before the basketball season began, he told me that Mate Okros would be in the opening night starting five. This took me by surprise because Okros, while a talented player, has had multiple chances at being a starter without much success in that role. Spiker explained this decision with a bold proclamation: that Okros would enter Drexel Men’s Basketball top 10 in career 3-point baskets made. Entering the season, Okros needed 47 made 3’s to crack the top 10. For the first ten games of the season, Okros only made six three-pointers on just 18 attempts. In the last eight games, however, Okros has made 18 threes on 37 attempts. Unsurprisingly, in those past eight games, the Dragons have seven wins. If Okros keeps shooting the ball, he can help lead the Dragons to postseason success while collecting individual accomplishments.</p>\n<p><b>Yame Butler: Get back in a groove</b></p>\n<p>It would not be hyperbolic to say the Yame Butler single handedly saved the 2022-2023 Drexel Basketball season. Butler dazzled the DAC with his tight handles and knack for getting to the rim and finishing through anyone in his way. Part of his skillset was also his shooting. Last season, Butler shot 45% from three-point range, and 87% from the free throw line. This season, however, Butler is shooting just 22% from deep and 68% from the charity stripe. Butler is one of a select few Dragons who can create his own shot through his dribbling ability and athleticism, and there's no stopping this offense if Butler can return to the form he has proven capable of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amari Williams: Play 30 minutes</b></p>\n<p>Amari Williams is the best player on the Dragons roster and can be the best player in the CAA if he wants to be. If you were to look at Amari’s statistics, however, you might think he is underperforming. As a wildly athletic, nearly seven-foot center, Williams probably should be averaging more than 12 points and 8 rebounds per game. However, when you consider the fact that Williams’ season high in minutes is 32, and he averages just 21 minutes, those statistics jump off the page a whole lot more. Williams’ health has to be preserved, and there is no sense in subjecting your star center to needless abuse in games that are not close. However, with important postseason games on the horizon, it is entirely likely that the Dragons will need Williams to stay on the court for over 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><b>Chloe Hodges: Get a double-double</b></p>\n<p>After averaging five points-per-game last season, Hodges has cemented herself as a crucial player for the Dragons. The Senior forward has had some explosive offensive performances, most notably her 21 point showing against Northeastern earlier in January. However, as one of the few players above 6 feet tall on Drexel Women's Basketball team, Hodges also has an important role as a rebounder. She is the team’s leader in collected boards, and she has amassed seven rebounds on five separate occasions. While Amaris Baker recently collected the team’s first double-double of the season, it is Hodges who most frequently flirts with that impressive statline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Grace O'Neill: Level up</b></p>\n<p>In her freshman season, O’Neill turned heads as a jack-of-all-trades point guard who chipped in on every single column of the stat sheet. While this is still true in her sophomore year, O’Neill is averaging less points, steals and rebounds, all while shooting at a significantly less efficient clip. The Dragons are a formidable team and O’Neill is a big part of that, but if they hope to make some noise in 2024, she will have to not only regain her previous level, but raise it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amy Mallon: Find some more points</b></p>\n<p>While Mallon has put in a terrific effort to get her roster playing as well as she has, one area that can improve is the offense. While the Dragons have still scored more points than they’ve let up, their offense is far from lethal. As a team, the Dragons have shot just over 40% from the field and 30% from deep. In the CAA, Drexel is 11th out of the 14 schools in average points per game. One change could lie in freshman Laine McGurk who is 8th in minutes played yet 4th in points-per-game.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Despite it being nearly five years since 21 Savage released his last solo album, he has never strayed far from the spotlight in that time. This could be a result of the ridiculous feature run he has been on the last few years on what feels like every album that comes out. Or it could be because of his massively successful collaborative albums, such as 2020’s \"Savage Mode 2\" with producer Metro Boomin’, or 2022’s \"Her Loss,\" a partnership with Drake. It could also be because of what 21 gets up to outside of music, most notably his 2019 arrest, due to the fact that he was essentially an illegal immigrant, having moved to the United States from England nearly 20 years ago while having no documentation for a majority of that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This whole situation was seemingly the inspiration for his new album, titled \"American Dream.\" For the first time since 2018, 21 is back in the saddle, and throughout the album, it is clear that 21 and only 21 was in control of the creative choices. Sometimes this leads to moments that although unexpected, definitely work, and are worth the risk. However, these chances often fall flat, resulting in songs that are not necessarily bad, but just not what anyone wants to hear from 21.</p>\n<p>The album begins with a spoken-word intro from 21 Savage’s mother, with her discussing the risks they took that allowed 21 to be who he is, presumably referring to their decision to immigrate to the U.S., or even to the struggles that they faced well after moving. In the next song, titled “All of Me,” 21 dives right into those struggles in traditional 21 fashion, giving an extremely detailed look into what he’s been through, which, according to him involved a lot of violence, murder and loss. The next song, “redrum” (\"murder\" backward), sees 21 go even further into these topics. On the hook, Savage continuously repeats the line “G block, all we know is redrum,” implying that where he grew up, murder and violence were normal, if not necessary in order to make it out, a stark contrast to the idea of the American dream.</p>\n<p>Savage switches up his energy on the next few songs, starting with “n.h.i.e.,” with an unexpected feature from Doja Cat. Although he sings about similar subject matter to the last few songs, sonically this is a different 21 Savage than ever before, giving his most melodic performance to date, and a beautiful one at that. This song is one of the album's many highlights and an example of what 21 is capable of when he goes out of his comfort zone. He takes a similar R&amp;B route on a three-track run later in the album with the songs “see the real,” “prove it” and “should’ve worn a bonnet,” with the latter two featuring Summer Walker and Brent Faiyaz, respectively. These songs and others scattered throughout the album also see 21 in his melodic bag, a side of him that certainly needs to come out more often.</p>\n<p>Other gems include the handful of Metro-produced songs, and despite how great 21 has sounded on other types of instrumentals, this is his bread and butter, and 21 at his very best. In the modern rap landscape, it is hard to find someone better than 21 on a Metro beat. The chemistry between the two is just too strong, and when they work together they are able to create a sound that just cannot be replicated, no matter how hard someone may try. Examples on the album include the songs “nee-nah” with Travis Scott and “pop ur shit” with Young Thug.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite how far all of the artists have come in their careers and all their success, the Atlanta trap songs are the ones that made them who they are, and on these songs, it is very clear that they have not lost a step. The standout track on the album, however, is the song “letter to my brudda.” Over a relaxed sample-based beat and a piano melody, 21 goes for nearly three minutes straight, mostly discussing his longtime friend and collaborator Young Thug and his current situation. Thug and a collection of his labelmates are involved in an ongoing RICO case, alleging that Thug’s music label is in fact a violent gang. 21 provides his perspective on the situation, and what it is like to watch his friend have his freedom ripped away from him. He also touches on Gunna’s role in the situation, which involved the rapper, a former collaborator of both 21 and Young Thug, seemingly ratting on Thug and his labelmates for his own benefit, something 21 makes clear he disapproves of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the track, 21 lays all his thoughts and emotions out there, not holding a single thing back. In fact, being brutally honest and real is what attracts people to 21 and his music. He doesn’t sugarcoat anything, which may be gruesome at times, but at the end of the day, it allows him to paint a picture that not many others can replicate. So even though the style of his music may change a little bit, the sincerity of his music has never faltered, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to anytime soon.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>&nbsp;GIANT Heirloom Market at 3401 Chestnut St. was ordered to cease operations by the Philadelphia Department of Health on the morning of Thursday, Jan. 18. A notice was stamped to the front doors of the building stating the violation, as well as declaring any occupancy after 11:50 a.m. as “illegal.” It is currently unclear when or if the location will be reopening.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Around 5:00 p.m., a small group of people stood in front of the door, some trying to shop there and some curious about the commotion’s cause. This Heirloom Market is the largest grocery store on Drexel’s campus, with the other grocery alternatives being the convenience stores Old Nelson, 7-Eleven, Wawa and Northside Dining Terrace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seven to ten people could be seen inside the store from the front windows, most wearing Heirloom Market clothing. A single security guard was standing within the entryway. Employees were also seen cleaning in the produce department, sweeping the floors and moving the coolers. In the checkout section, multiple registers were partially opened, and wooden mouse traps had been set and placed underneath the kiosks. Two to four people were in this area, and a large vacuum was present.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Department of Health order sign stated that the building had failed to comply with <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/philadelphia/latest/philadelphia_pa/0-0-0-272773#JD_Chapter6-300\"><u>Title 6, Chapter 300 of the Philadelphia Code</u></a>, which covers food safety. No further information was listed regarding the specifics of the violation. The document also stated that the business would have to be reinspected and certified by the Health Department in order to reopen, which would require a payment of $315 for reinspection. However, GIANT Heirloom has the right to appeal their violation within the next 30 days.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The 81st annual Golden Globes was held in Beverly Hills, California on Jan. 7. The event, though down in TV viewership since last year, has taken the internet by storm. The host, comedian Jo Koy, has faced backlash after some insensitive jokes, especially ones made toward both Taylor Swift and the Barbie movie. With all the controversy, it was easy to miss the other, more positive things that occurred at the glamorous event. So, what else happened at the 2024 Golden Globes? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As members of the Philadelphia community, it is noteworthy that a Temple graduate won a Golden Globe. Da’Vine Joy Randolph, now 37, went to Temple University for her undergraduate program. She originally studied classical vocal music, with the dream of being an opera singer. After auditioning for an opera role in a Temple musical, she hired an acting coach to help her train. This caused a commotion at the school, ending with Randolph having to leave the program and pursue a degree in musical theater. Randolph graduated from Temple and went on to study at Yale and perform on Broadway before making it to Hollywood. Of late, she has been critically acclaimed for her work, finally securing a Golden Globe win for Best Supporting Actress in the 2023 film, \"The Holdovers.\"</p>\n<p>The night was full of first-time winners, including Lily Gladstone for Best Actress. Gladstone made history with her win, as she is the first Indigenous person to win an acting Golden Globe. She was born in Montana and had a desire to act from a young age. She performed all throughout her academic career, which culminated in a degree from the University of Montana. After college, Gladstone began to act in movies, with her first debut in 2012. By 2016, she was winning awards for her work, like the Best Supporting Actress award from the Boston Society of Film Critics. In 2023, Gladstone was the female lead in \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" Her performance in this role won her the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next two first-time winners came as a surprise to many Golden Globe viewers. After the theatrical event of the year “Barbenheimer,” it was expected that the stars of both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" would walk away with significant recognition. However, many were shocked to hear that Cillian Murphy won his first-ever Golden Globe for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. Murphy has also famously been featured in \"Peaky Blinders\" and \"28 Days Later.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After the success of \"Oppenheimer,\" another name circulating in film news was Christopher Nolan, the director of the film. Nolan and Murphy had worked together on six different films over the years, but it seems as though \"Oppenheimer\" was their first breakthrough at the Golden Globes. Christopher Nolan also took home his first Golden Globe for Best Director Motion Picture, which was a relief for him after four previous nominations for the award that did not result in wins. &nbsp;The other half of the “Barbenheimer” duo, <i>Barbie</i>, did not go home empty-handed either. The film won awards for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement and Best Original Song – Motion Picture for Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Oppenheimer\" was the ultimate winner of the night with five awards, but \"The Holdovers\"<i> </i>and \"Beef\" also earned themselves a few awards as well. While the event may have been surrounded by controversy over the host, that did not stop the stars from making history and celebrating their work together. The Golden Globes marks only the beginning of award season, as many are looking towards the Oscars. Currently, \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\" are predicted to continue their winning streak, and both Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Lily Gladstone’s names have also been thrown around. The Oscars will be live on March 10, when the celebrities will reunite, though with a different host this time. Will \"Oppenheimer\" prevail once again, or will another winner emerge? Only time will tell.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>What is the human race capable of when thrust into overwhelmingly adverse survival conditions? A prime display of such a situation came in the aftermath of a failed flight from Montevideo, Uruguay to Santiago, Chile in October 1972. The flight in question, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, carried 40 passengers, 19 of whom were members of the Old Christians Rugby Club, with the others consisting of the team’s friends and family. On Oct. 13, 1972, the flight met an unexpected and fatal end, as the aircraft collided violently with the Andes mountains. In the subsequent 72 days, those remaining after the crash braved the harsh, uncaring cold of the Andes in hopes of survival. Their story has been the subject of multiple film adaptations, first in 1976 with “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075290/\"><u>Survive!</u></a>,” followed more notably by “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/\"><u>Alive</u></a>” in 1993. However, Spanish film director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1291105/\"><u>J.A. Bayona</u></a> dares to present the most faithful representation of the historical tale put to screen in his latest survival thriller “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81268316\"><u>Society of the Snow</u></a>.”</p>\n<p>Released on Jan. 4 as a Netflix exclusive, “La Sociedad de la Nieve” draws abundant inspiration from Pablo Vierci’s 2008 <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/pablo-vierci/society-of-the-snow/9781408716373/\"><u>novel of the same name</u></a>, which heavily relies on firsthand accounts from the accident’s 16 remaining survivors. Thus, Bayona’s adaptation supplies itself with ample means to accurately convey the perilous experiences of the stranded passengers. Much of the film’s looming sense of grim, isolating chaos comes from its string of finely-tuned technical decisions. Case in point: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1939549/\">Pedro Luque's</a> cinematography excels in capturing the intended chilling tone and atmosphere. Luque’s work effectively thrusts audiences from Montevideo’s alluringly vibrant scenery to the Andes’ bleak stretches of snow, maximizing immersion in the protagonists’ tumultuous journey. Bayona’s decision to shoot most of the movie <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/shot-list-society-of-the-snow-netflix-ja-bayona-awards-insider\"><u>in the Sierra Nevada</u></a> instead of a typical film set further adds to the feeling of being dropped into an unwelcoming landscape with slim chances of survival. In addition, the makeup and costume design greatly aid in visually communicating the severity of the situation through the deterioration of the characters’ physical appearances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The simplicity of the storytelling on display in “Society of the Snow” is one of its most admirable features. Staying faithful to the events as told by the survivors, the film confidently takes little interest in manipulating the truth for heightened dramatic purposes, which seems common among similar Hollywood adaptations. This consistent commitment to authenticity results in a documentary-like style that does not concern itself with unnecessary theatrics or needless spectacle. That is not to say the film is devoid of its fair share of high-intensity moments, including the intentionally anxiety-inducing plane crash sequence near the start. These moments appear sparingly, however, and avoid exploitative sensationalism.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A similar degree of discipline is exercised in regard to the dialogue between characters and the portrayal of the characters themselves. For the most part, neither the writing nor the performances come across as overly cinematic, partly due to the palpable chemistry among the set of young actors. Consequently, viewers feel as though they are watching what would naturally unfold when a group of young friends are faced with the difficult decisions that arise throughout the film. Further, these challenges, including the debate over whether to resort to cannibalism for nourishment, are treated with a delicate maturity that invites the audience to arrive at their own conclusions regarding the moral dilemmas brought to light.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Unflinchingly miserable and dour at points, “Society of the Snow” ultimately prevails as an awe-inspiring retelling of the infamous Andes flight disaster. Bayona along with his talented cast and crew managed to mold this larger-than-life tale into an intimate experience that fully immerses viewers in both the tragedies and the beauties of the incident. In doing so, the film succeeds in either introducing or refamiliarizing modern audiences with the gripping story in a genuinely heartfelt, authentic manner.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Have you had a co-op? Are you currently working one or going through the application process? Drexel’s &nbsp;co-op program is one of the university’s main attractions, known for the advantages it offers to undergraduate students. However, after speaking with students around campus during the recent co-op cycle process for spring/summer 2024, many students expressed their concerns regarding the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second-year psychology student currently working at her first co-op claims, “Drexel advertises that we could make <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/academics/co-op/how-co-op-works\"><u>$20,000 </u></a>a co-op but as a psych major most of our options are either unpaid or offering a sum of money that is nowhere near what I expected.”</p>\n<p>Currently working 20 hours a week as an unpaid intern, she had to make the tough decision between experience and financial stability. The lack of paid positions, such as research positions, put students in difficult situations. Overlooking their financial situation is a privilege not every student has. Many students may give up an unpaid prestigious offer and accept a paid job because they cannot take the risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel should consider requiring their co-op employers to provide students with a stipend. The university needs to recognize that it is not feasible for the majority of students to receive no financial compensation whilst working for six months.</p>\n<p>Additionally, juggling multiple interviews during finals week is no easy feat. Especially for first-timers, the mixture of nerves and stress that come with preparing for interviews requires careful time management. Rushing from class to quickly change into proper business casual attire for your Zoom interview can leave you feeling both physically and mentally drained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the mandatory COOP 101 class students are required to take, many feel underprepared, learning to navigate the process as they go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third-year data science student shared her journey as she applied to co-ops for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I encountered many frustrations during the process, one of them being that you hear different types of information from different people. For example, when creating resumes COOP 101 has a different opinion on what should be on our resume compared to our co-op advisors. Then when you ask a student who has received a co-op already, they also have a difference of opinion on what should be included on our resumes. This makes the process pretty confusing as you don’t know what to include/not to include on your resume which also adds stress to whether you put the right things on it or not.”</p>\n<p>The student continued to express how she felt while balancing studying for her finals and getting last-minute projects/essays in on time at the same as giving interviews.</p>\n<p>“All of this adds a bit of pressure as you don’t know what to expect since there are so many different viewpoints on various parts of applying to co-ops.”</p>\n<p>Having recently undergone my first co-op cycle, my biggest advice to you all is to remain organized and strategically space out your interviews to avoid burnout.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to those who have already accepted an offer this co-op season and to those going into Round B, I wish you luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Safety is arguably the most important topic Drexel University students need to consider each quarter. With the bump in Philadelphia crime, including increased car thefts, violent robberies and even homicides, it is critical for students to take steps to ensure their own safety. I spoke with Dallas Drake, founder of the Center for Homicide Research, to discuss safety topics relevant to students at Drexel University. Drake is my former boss and an expert on homicide prevention as well as fire safety.</p>\n<p>Active shooters were the first topic we discussed. The Department of Homeland Security recommends a simple three-step approach to surviving an active shooter encounter – run, hide, fight. If you can run from the shooter that is the first thing you should do. The further away you are from them the more difficult it is for them to shoot you. Drake mentioned, “number one you should try to get away if there’s an active shooter. A lot of people want to see what’s happening when they hear a loud sound, don’t do that. Get the heck out of there!” If you are unable to run, you should hide until law enforcement arrives. For more information on how to act when law enforcement arrives you can read the <a href=\"https://https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf\">official Department of Homeland Security handbook on how to respond to active shooters.&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Finally, if neither of those options are available you should fight for your life. Active shooters often carry more than one weapon, so getting a firearm away from them does not necessarily mean you are safe. Drake mentioned success in past incidents where an active shooter was rushed by a group of people.</p>\n<p>Many people enter and exit through the same door every time they enter a building, which creates potential crowding around one door during a fire. There have been cases of people dying in fires simply because they didn’t know there was an exit behind them and were stuck trying to push their way through a crowd of people exiting through a single door. Drake mentioned an excellent point about smoke from fires stating, “In a fire, the exit signs are usually way up near the ceiling. The smoke rises and can cover the signs. It’s good to just know where the exits are instead of looking for the signs when an emergency is taking place.” Try to find out where all the exits are in a building and then go through them so you know where they will take you once outside. Drake went on to mention that people will follow their herd instinct and follow others in an emergency, even if it is the wrong way to go.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is involved in many crimes in one form or another. According to Drake, about 90% of all homicides involve alcohol use either by the victim, the offender, or both. Drake mentioned that alcohol reduces the ability of a victim to defend themselves or assess a dangerous situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drake commented on alcohol use and crime saying, “In most countries, the goal of alcohol use is more social than to become drunk. You don’t necessarily need to drink something with alcohol in it when you go out, but either way you don’t want to drink to the point that you lose control over yourself.”</p>\n<p>Don’t assume that offenders won’t be out in groups. Drake said of offenders traveling in groups, “Every time you have robbers or assaulters they seem to come in groups, often of at least three.” Drake had personal footage from his security system showing groups of three stealing from cars in his area. They have the upper hand in groups, but so can you. Drexel offers walking escorts 24/7, and there’s no shame in using an escort. Regardless of your size and strength, you likely won’t be able to take on a group of three attackers by yourself. <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/publicsafety/policing-security/escorts/\">To use a walking escort, simply call 215.895.2222 or use any of the blue-light emergency phones across campus</a>.</p>\n<p>The final topic Drake and I discussed was home safety. For starters, always lock your doors. This goes for your car door, house door and room door if you live in an apartment with roommates. Even if you have trustworthy roommates, you never know who they are bringing home with them. Locking your room door at night while you sleep is an added layer of security that will ensure intruders do not have easy access to you while you are asleep. Drake suggested using two locks on your front door, “It’s good to have two locks on the door in case someone breaks through a door window to unlock the door. Find ways to give yourself the upper hand. If you lived outdoors, you’d need to watch out for bears, elk, and wolves. There’s no expectation of safety anywhere, so the fact you need to be a little concerned in your house shouldn’t bother you.”</p>\n<p>Safety is a complex subject and there are many topics Drake and I didn’t get the chance to discuss. Crime is preventable, but you need to take steps to ensure your own safety. There are several great videos on YouTube talking about various safety topics. We strongly encourage you to look up topics related to safety in your free time.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>If you’re starting to feel like these “unprecedented times” have become rather precedented, or like the last four years have been like one really long, really horrible year, you aren’t alone. Lots of people are entering 2024 anxious about what the future holds and, as a result, feeling helpless to do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe the state of the world has been snowballing downhill for the last half of a decade, or maybe it’s always been this way and we feel the turbulence more keenly now as we stumble into (or further into) adulthood. It’s most likely the latter, but in any case, it seems like with each glance at the news the world grows more weary, nervously anticipating the subject line of the next notification to light our screens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would not make the case that a state of turmoil, even at this level, is something unique to this decade, but I would wager that we feel the pressure more than our recent ancestors did, as we are now so deeply connected to each other in a way humanity has never experienced. It’s also true that too many of us are so consumed by the bad news of our own countries to think too much about that of the others. (Hopefully I’m not the first to remind you that it’s a presidential election year in the US…again? Already?)</p>\n<p>In the most difficult times, though, I think it’s important that we let things be only as bad as they are. It was Martin Luther King, Jr. who said that we should “accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope,” Mother Teresa who told us that our strength lies in the small things and Hank Green, perhaps the true voice of our generation, who told us that although no one person can change the world in any significant way, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ&amp;list=LLT1y18e5NgYwsVnATbQrArg&amp;index=27\"><u>“no one doesn’t change it at all</u></a><u>.</u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ&amp;list=LLT1y18e5NgYwsVnATbQrArg&amp;index=27\"><u>”</u></a> So, I implore you to find your own ways to make a dark world a little brighter. Hold a door, share some books, and find some bright spots where you can.

He introduced Nanu’s to Drexel University with two of his three brothers: Ikram and Haroom. The Rashid brothers established their first cart in New York in 2003, as a surprise for their mother who was worried about their youngest brother, Adnan, due to his Down syndrome diagnosis. Five years later, the family moved to Philadelphia where they opened their first location at 2210 Cottman Ave during the summer of 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the grand opening on Drexel's campus, Nanu’s opened a truck on Temple’s campus two months earlier, so they now have three locations. Rashid explained that his dream is to expand beyond Philadelphia and even beyond Pennsylvania. He hinted at opening a new location in New York in the future.</p>\n<p>Students had been awaiting the arrival of this new food truck for many weeks and were overjoyed when they saw “free food” written across the banner of the truck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I was expecting to serve maybe 300-400 meals that day, ” Rashid said. However, over 700 meals were served on opening day with a line that barely fluctuated as more students arrived.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I slept well that night,” said Rashid.</p>\n<p>Some students told him that the spiciest chicken option, the reaper, was not hot enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Wow!” was all Rashid could reply. “I always get a medium because it's hot enough.” He plans to create a spicier option for those searching for more heat than just the reaper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although it is always good to have a delicious hot chicken truck just a block or two away from classes, Rashid emphasized that “Nanu’s is not just about the food but about family and friends coming together to think about those who are in need of help… and giving back to the community.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rashid explained that the truck was named after his youngest brother, Adnan: “We call him Nanu…that’s his nickname.”</p>\n<p>On behalf of his brothers, Rashid was positively overwhelmed with the turnout at Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I wanted to thank everyone who showed up. Nanu’s is not just a sandwich-serving-little-hut, it will become a brand to support others.”&nbsp;</p>",

Drexel’s &nbsp;co-op program is one of the university’s main attractions, known for the advantages it offers to undergraduate students. However, after speaking with students around campus during the recent co-op cycle process for spring/summer 2024, many students expressed their concerns regarding the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second-year psychology student currently working at her first co-op claims, “Drexel advertises that we could make <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/academics/co-op/how-co-op-works\"><u>$20,000 </u></a>a co-op but as a psych major most of our options are either unpaid or offering a sum of money that is nowhere near what I expected.”</p>\n<p>Currently working 20 hours a week as an unpaid intern, she had to make the tough decision between experience and financial stability. The lack of paid positions, such as research positions, put students in difficult situations. Overlooking their financial situation is a privilege not every student has. Many students may give up an unpaid prestigious offer and accept a paid job because they cannot take the risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel should consider requiring their co-op employers to provide students with a stipend. The university needs to recognize that it is not feasible for the majority of students to receive no financial compensation whilst working for six months.</p>\n<p>Additionally, juggling multiple interviews during finals week is no easy feat. Especially for first-timers, the mixture of nerves and stress that come with preparing for interviews requires careful time management. Rushing from class to quickly change into proper business casual attire for your Zoom interview can leave you feeling both physically and mentally drained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the mandatory COOP 101 class students are required to take, many feel underprepared, learning to navigate the process as they go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third-year data science student shared her journey as she applied to co-ops for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I encountered many frustrations during the process, one of them being that you hear different types of information from different people. For example, when creating resumes COOP 101 has a different opinion on what should be on our resume compared to our co-op advisors. Then when you ask a student who has received a co-op already, they also have a difference of opinion on what should be included on our resumes. This makes the process pretty confusing as you don’t know what to include/not to include on your resume which also adds stress to whether you put the right things on it or not.”</p>\n<p>The student continued to express how she felt while balancing studying for her finals and getting last-minute projects/essays in on time at the same as giving interviews.</p>\n<p>“All of this adds a bit of pressure as you don’t know what to expect since there are so many different viewpoints on various parts of applying to co-ops.”</p>\n<p>Having recently undergone my first co-op cycle, my biggest advice to you all is to remain organized and strategically space out your interviews to avoid burnout.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to those who have already accepted an offer this co-op season and to those going into Round B, I wish you luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.&nbsp;</p>",

It is one thing to engage in honest inquiry and robust debate about complex issues. It is another to traffic in hateful slogans and symbols that have nothing to do with inquiry or debate,” President Fry wrote.</p>\n<p>In addition, President Fry paid homage to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his email to the Drexel community: “In the meantime, as we begin this winter quarter, we must rededicate ourselves to the work of following Dr. King's blueprint for building a beloved community: Let's strive mindfully to learn, empathize, and grow together across our different backgrounds, perspectives, and viewpoints, and mine our diversity as a source of strength.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, CCI Dean Yi Deng sent a message to all faculty and students regarding the incident.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“CCI is a community that welcomes everyone and fosters inclusivity and mutual respect. This repugnant behavior is completely unacceptable and is categorically not within the fabric of our College, nor the University as a whole,” Yi Deng wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked to provide a University statement, Vice President of Strategic Communications Niki Gianakaris stated, “Drexel University is committed to ensuring a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment for all of our students, faculty and professional staff. The University does not tolerate acts of bias, discrimination and harassment. The University condemns discrimination in all its forms, including hate speech and threats of violence, and will continue working to fulfill its commitments to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further details of the investigation have not been revealed. At this time, it is unclear who wrote the message or what exactly was written.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Gianakaris, “The University community will be updated once the investigation concludes.”</p>\n<p>This incident follows reports of antisemitism in the previous Fall term, as reported on Oct. 20, 2023 by <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/arson-and-antisemitic-graffiti-heighten-fears-of-hate-crime-on-drexel-campus/\"><u>The Triangle</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The campus is grounds not only for sociability but also for developing a community, and that entails supporting the small businesses within it. While there are not shops set up around campus, students have gotten creative with establishing themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Freshman product design major and Philadelphia native Juliet Wang-Herrera uses her passion for design for her side-hustle as a nail artist.</p>\n<p>“The short version as to why that’s my passion is because I simply wanted to,” she joked. “My professional answer is that I just wanted to be a designer. Product design allows me to explore that in a more intensive way.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeing how in her free time she is constantly creating and exploring new mediums, Wang-Herrera has expanded that into creating nail extensions and press-ons for students who cannot have long nails but want the artistic appeal of acrylics. Her art style mainly consists of 3D work and bright colors that are reflected within her products.</p>\n<p>Wang-Herrera provides acrylic and gel services and sells press ons to those who may be more comfortable with them. She also does soak offs and nail repairs for her clients. A Westphal student, Wang-Herrera is able to use her tools as her paintbrushes and her clients’ nails as the canvas in order to create beautiful works of art. From nails displaying intricate designs that are reminiscent of celebrities such as Kali Uchis to others that show cute characters such as Kirby and Hello Kitty, she is not only showing her skills but helping her customers wear their personalities on their fingers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I welcome everyone to my desk but I’m really trying to reach people who love nails as much as I do and want to explore different textures and styles that they wouldn’t get at your typical nail salon,” said Wang-Herrera.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked what makes her shop different to others, she explained that she is willing to try new things with her clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Everyone showcases their creativity in different ways, ways that in some cases I have never thought of. I am willing to go that extra mile and make sure that my clients are happy. I will listen to your stories too. When you sit with me, I like to say you’re getting a two in one special: beautiful nails and someone to lend you an ear. That’s how my customers and I end up becoming good friends by the end of it.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Describing her brand in one word, Wang-Herrera said, “Layered. Just like people, I like to say that my work comes in layers both physically and metaphorically. On the surface level, my tools are there to help perform the task successfully but the way I look at it is that each buff I make, every coat of polish is a reflection of the person sitting at my table. There’s different formulas and different layers within my process to get to that end result. I am also someone with layers. It’s not just one version of me that I’m willing to show. I’m also willing to help others do the same.”</p>\n<p>Find her on Instagram (@nails.byjuliet) to schedule an appointment. Her prices range from $30-$90.</p>\n<p><i>This article is part of a column dedicated to supporting small businesses on Drexel University's campus.&nbsp;</i></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Safety is arguably the most important topic Drexel University students need to consider each quarter. With the bump in Philadelphia crime, including increased car thefts, violent robberies and even homicides, it is critical for students to take steps to ensure their own safety. I spoke with Dallas Drake, founder of the Center for Homicide Research, to discuss safety topics relevant to students at Drexel University. Drake is my former boss and an expert on homicide prevention as well as fire safety.</p>\n<p>Active shooters were the first topic we discussed. The Department of Homeland Security recommends a simple three-step approach to surviving an active shooter encounter – run, hide, fight. If you can run from the shooter that is the first thing you should do. The further away you are from them the more difficult it is for them to shoot you. Drake mentioned, “number one you should try to get away if there’s an active shooter. A lot of people want to see what’s happening when they hear a loud sound, don’t do that. Get the heck out of there!” If you are unable to run, you should hide until law enforcement arrives. For more information on how to act when law enforcement arrives you can read the official Department of Homeland Security handbook on how to respond to active shooters: <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf\"><u>https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf</u></a> Finally, if neither of those options are available you should fight for your life. Active shooters often carry more than one weapon, so getting a firearm away from them does not necessarily mean you are safe. Drake mentioned success in past incidents where an active shooter was rushed by a group of people.</p>\n<p>Many people enter and exit through the same door every time they enter a building, which creates potential crowding around one door during a fire. There have been cases of people dying in fires simply because they didn’t know there was an exit behind them and were stuck trying to push their way through a crowd of people exiting through a single door. Drake mentioned an excellent point about smoke from fires stating, “In a fire, the exit signs are usually way up near the ceiling. The smoke rises and can cover the signs. It’s good to just know where the exits are instead of looking for the signs when an emergency is taking place.” Try to find out where all the exits are in a building and then go through them so you know where they will take you once outside. Drake went on to mention that people will follow their herd instinct and follow others in an emergency, even if it is the wrong way to go.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is involved in many crimes in one form or another. According to Drake, about 90% of all homicides involve alcohol use either by the victim, the offender, or both. Drake mentioned that alcohol reduces the ability of a victim to defend themselves or assess a dangerous situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drake commented on alcohol use and crime saying, “In most countries, the goal of alcohol use is more social than to become drunk. You don’t necessarily need to drink something with alcohol in it when you go out, but either way you don’t want to drink to the point that you lose control over yourself.”</p>\n<p>Don’t assume that offenders won’t be out in groups. Drake said of offenders traveling in groups, “Every time you have robbers or assaulters they seem to come in groups, often of at least three.” Drake had personal footage from his security system showing groups of three stealing from cars in his area. They have the upper hand in groups, but so can you. Drexel offers walking escorts 24/7, and there’s no shame in using an escort. Regardless of your size and strength, you likely won’t be able to take on a group of three attackers by yourself. To use a walking escort, simply call 215.895.2222 or use any of the blue-light emergency phones across campus (https://drexel.edu/publicsafety/policing-security/escorts/).</p>\n<p>The final topic Drake and I discussed was home safety. For starters, always lock your doors. This goes for your car door, house door and room door if you live in an apartment with roommates. Even if you have trustworthy roommates, you never know who they are bringing home with them. Locking your room door at night while you sleep is an added layer of security that will ensure intruders do not have easy access to you while you are asleep. Drake suggested using two locks on your front door, “It’s good to have two locks on the door in case someone breaks through a door window to unlock the door. Find ways to give yourself the upper hand. If you lived outdoors, you’d need to watch out for bears, elk, and wolves. There’s no expectation of safety anywhere, so the fact you need to be a little concerned in your house shouldn’t bother you.”</p>\n<p>Safety is a complex subject and there are many topics Drake and I didn’t get the chance to discuss. Crime is preventable, but you need to take steps to ensure your own safety. There are several great videos on YouTube talking about various safety topics. We strongly encourage you to look up topics related to safety in your free time.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>There is no question that the university model is in crisis. Lingering financial stress due to the pandemic, unpopular tuition hikes and a dwindling pool of applicants have been putting the pressure on colleges and universities to adapt to the fact that many students are losing faith in the worth of a college degree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in response to the adversities, institution closures and mergers are becoming a trend, with the biggest impacts being seen in <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/how-many-colleges-and-universities-have-closed-since-2016/539379/\"><u>New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and California</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This trend is present here in Pennsylvania, too; we have seen a complete shutdown at Cabrini University, shocking students with the announcement that it would be closing its doors in 2024, while big universities are absorbing smaller ones, as our neighbors at the University of the Sciences join St. Joseph’s University and Salus University in Elkins Park prepares to merge with Drexel sometime next year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The exact value of a college degree is debatable in the modern age, but it is clearly still a favorable path for many young adults. Thus, the question remains — how prepared are university leaders for the major challenges of commanding an institution of higher learning and how can they keep their schools immune to the resulting damages?</p>\n<p>Drexel’s Pennoni Honors College’s Pennoni Panels are known for their open discussions regarding topics of concern in all sectors of modern discourse. Their ongoing interview show, \"Civil Discourse,\" recently had Honors College Dean Paula Morantz Cohen sit down with three college presidents for a discussion on the threats faced by the modern university. \"Civil Discourse,\" according to Cohen, aims to discuss “important, often controversial topics with candor and good will.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Future of the University Panel featured Nora Demleitner, president of St. John’s College in Annapolis, Maryland, Dr. Jonathan Holloway, president of Rutgers University in New Jersey and our own president, John Fry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A large problem that the presidents cited they face is popularity among their student bodies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you want to be loved, get a dog,” quipped Dr. Holloway. “No matter what type of university you helm, if a problem comes to your attention, it means that it hasn’t been solved by really smart people on at least two or three different attempts. So by the time it lands on your plate… …any decision I make, I’ll personalize it, [so] I’m automatically making somebody else unhappy. That will have a permanent effect on how your presidency is understood.”</p>\n<p>A large part of the issue with popularity and a major frustration among students everywhere is transparency, or a lack of it, between the student body and the administration. Students of The College of Saint Rose in New York, which announced its <a href=\"https://www.news10.com/news/saint-rose-students-protest-college-closure-demand-answers/\"><u>forthcoming closure</u></a> on Dec. 1 2023, are outraged at the sudden and unexpected news. Students now have less than a year to figure out what they are going to do next, with little to no previous warning from the college, whose board had been discussing the possibility of closure for some time before making the final decision Nov. 30 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked how to balance demands from pressure groups such as the student body and the board of trustees, President Fry said, “Every year has been my hardest year. I think what I’ve discovered is that the important thing is to keep a network within [and outside] the institution… …so you’re not backed up against the wall when a decision will be made, [which] is going to be unpopular one way or the other.”</p>\n<p>Fry continued to talk about his position in handling the student protests to Drexel’s involvement in the affordable housing crisis last year. Though it was not an easy discussion to have, Fry believes the dialogue between himself and the students was productive and respectful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All three presidents discussed at some point in the panel the value of making college accessible, citing the percentages of their student bodies that are Pell Eligible or First Generation. President Demleitner also praises St. John’s unique model as a reason why their institution stands out, with every class being held seminar-style. Fry spoke similarly of Drexel’s cooperative education model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dean Cohen and the presidents also discussed free speech, campus safety, mental health and the recent Supreme Court proceedings on Affirmative Action.</p>\n<p>“Presidents have to walk the fine line where we are lowering the temperature in terms of speech so that people can hear each other, while preserving campus safety,” said Dr. Holloway of free speech at Rutgers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding Affirmative Action, Fry said that though the institution must comply to the proceedings, it will not change its internal value set. This was echoed by the other panelists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We can’t turn our back on who we are, why we were founded, and who we are today… …we will continue to seek out the kind of rich diversity that characterizes our university,” Fry added.</p>\n<p>The problems faced by universities through their selectiveness and inclusivity are important discussions to have, but the biggest threat to the university model is the belief that it is becoming obsolete.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I do think we are living in a moment where people are reducing higher education to this transactional value,” said Dr. Holloway. “How much does it cost per class, or whatever metric you’re going to use to measure it… and that statistic is usually wrong …and that is higher ed’s fault for not telling the story accurately …and what am I going to get in return transactionally?”</p>\n<p>Dr. Holloway went on to say that, although it is true that colleges must prepare students for a career in their field of study, and the return on investment should be lucrative, college also serves as a time to teach “a heightened sense of social skills, like understanding an apparatus of how to operate in the world do that when they’re on the job market, they can thrive.”</p>\n<p>President Demleitner believes the university model survives and prevails because of “the power of curriculum,” which gives students the opportunity to engage in complex and deeply personal discourse founded on their unique backgrounds and identities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dean Cohen asked of President Fry his thoughts on the corporatization of the university model, to which Fry replied, given the number of professional employees and students, the University is bound to “use those investments from our students and families wisely, and to steer the university in the right direction, in the right way.” Fry continued, “[We have to] protect the dollars that we have so that we can invest them directly into academics… …if that’s corporatization, then I’m all for it.”</p>\n<p>“We organize ourselves around our own convenience, the convenience of our administration [and faculty], and the students are the ones that have to navigate this. Guilty as charged on the bureaucracy question,” joked Fry, “What we’re working on right now is, how do we simplify our systems so it is possible for students to really have a much more bespoke experience.”</p>\n<p>The panel wrapped up on the topic of rankings, such as the ones done by the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges\"><u>U.S. News &amp; World Report</u></a>, where Drexel has recently ascended into the top 100 universities list. Completely arbitrary and “troubling in every way,” &nbsp;though the rankings are, as stated by Dr. Holloway, the panelists agreed that although there are too many other factors at play, and the rankings made by these large news companies cannot be standardized to all students, it is still evidently important to incoming students and must be considered.</p>\n<p>With limited time to address an endless list of issues faced by modern universities, it was inevitable that the panel would only scratch the surface. It is clearly true that these presidents, and most college presidents, are intelligent, well-educated and well-equipped to manage their schools. But in the face of adversity, which model prevails? A large, publicly funded state university like Rutgers, a slightly smaller, private, research-focused university like Drexel, or a small liberal arts college focused on discourse and community like St. John’s?</p>\n<p>The current trends of university closures make it hard to tell right now, but it is undeniable that all of the panelists’ institutions have merit in their current operations and diverse student bodies. The question of which model will prevail, which will survive the current hardships and move on to face the next set of challenges, is one that must be left to time.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>PAX Unplugged is a tabletop gaming convention hosted at the Philadelphia Convention Center every December. The event features an overwhelming number of tabletop games including crowd favorites like Settlers of Catan and Munchkin. It's best to arrive as early as possible to get the most out of the day. PAX Unplugged offers both day passes and full weekend passes, but a single day pass is adequate for most casual tabletop fans as long as you arrive early. The convention starts at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, but the line to get in will wrap around the building before the doors even open. Expect to wait in line for at least an hour if you arrive any time before 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>Once inside the convention center, prepare for an overwhelming amount of things to see and do. The best way to approach an event like this is to pick a direction and start walking. This event is best experienced with a small group of friends, but plenty of people attend by themselves as well. You will be looking at a lot of board and card game items available for purchase. There were also several artists selling artwork at the convention.</p>\n<p>The long wait to get in means that most people won’t see much before lunchtime. Food and drink items are sparse and expensive inside the convention center. A souvenir cup vendor selling sodas and mugs was outrageously expensive at $50. This included a mug, lid and straw which were all sold separately. Some of the mug setups they were selling were even more expensive than that! It can be difficult to justify these prices, and with so many great restaurants in Chinatown, it does not make sense to purchase food or beverages inside the convention center. Be prepared to either pack a lunch or eat outside of the convention center.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to play three games while attending the event. The games were Squid Game: Let the Games Begin, Star Wars: Unlimited, and the Pokémon trading card game. Squid Game: Let the Games Begin was the clear favorite among the three games. The board game follows the events of the show perfectly and utilizes a timer to keep players on edge. Fans of the show will enjoy the opportunity to play variations of the games played by the show’s characters.This was a casual game that anyone could pick up and learn. The second game was a Star Wars themed trading card game coming out this year. Fans of Star Wars will enjoy seeing beloved characters in a trading card game, but the rules were confusing. A few slight tweaks to the game could make it one of the best card games out there, but it is likely too late to make those types of changes. The third game was a classic – the Pokémon trading card game. The play area was bright and colorful. The game was taught by a staff member who was patient and clearly enjoyed Pokémon. Many people collected Pokémon cards when they were young but not nearly as many people knew how to play the trading card game. At the end of the demo the staff gave out free cards so that players could play the game at home. The card game was fun and easy to learn. A free pin was also given out which made a great souvenir to remember the day.</p>\n<p>While the convention is designed for more hardcore tabletop gamers, it can still be an enjoyable space for more casual players. None of the people in my small group were hardcore gamers, and we occasionally made jokes about playing Uno at some point during the convention. The event even includes appearances by a handful of celebrities who signed autographs and answered questions during panels. If you have never been to PAX Unplugged, I enthusiastically recommend giving it a try at least once. In summary – pack a lunch, arrive early, wear comfortable walking shoes and play some games!</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>We have officially entered week two of the new term. The professors have finished housekeeping, the assignments are coming down on us, and all around, students are gearing up for battle. To keep from losing ourselves on the academic warfront, here's a rundown of the latest updates on campus news.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia's Moody Weather: What exactly is Mother Nature up to? Temperatures rose as high as 54 degrees Fahrenheit last week, and I think we all became too familiar with what summer on campus will be like on the third floor of the Main Building. In contrast, this week came with a blend of rain and flurries and snow and wind chills. And what has Drexel administration been doing in response to nature’s mood swings?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a three-day weekend came an uprooted sleep schedule, and the promise of over three inches of snow gave rise to both expectations and disappointments this week. Waking up at the crack of dawn to the sound of my brother’s high school voicemail announcing that classes were canceled was painful, especially since Drexel offered a delay on normal operations until…10 a.m.? We still had to attend some classes on Zoom, which was enough to transport us back through time into the groggy routine of COVID-ridden 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was exactly three steps outside and a slip of the foot later while on my way to my 6 p.m. orgo lecture when I started hoping Friday’s snow will do a better job on keeping us inside. I gather here all my hope for a commuter friendly week.</p>\n<p>Rise of the Nanu’s Hot Chicken Cult: I spent 40 minutes in a waiting line. The blaring sun blinded my eyes while I inched toward the bright orange truck that was, apparently, going to revolutionize campus food with its hot chicken. We were like sheep, flocking toward the warmth of crispy fries and tender meat. The blanket of creamy sauce was calling to us. Some canceled meetings. Some ditched classes. And some stayed in line for four hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My only question: Was the Nashville hot chicken worth the wait?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many disappointed students did not get to relish the deal. Some had enough of the wait and opted for the less busy food trucks that were teasingly close, and others, like me, decided it was finally time to attend their classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, I bring to you four descriptions to shed light on the taste of Nanu’s Hot Chicken, provided to me through the grapevine: “tender chicken cradled in a warm bed of soft buns,” “perfect mixture of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside” and “golden seasoned fries with a finesse.” Do with that what you must.</p>\n<p>Basement or Bane?: Gone is the comfort of a cushiony lounging area of study, the plushness of a well-used sofa. And enter an amalgam of off-putting orange and long legs and tiny rectangles. In all its glory, what exactly is the new layout of Hagerty Library’s basement?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will say that I hate to judge a book by its cover, so there will come an attempt on The Triangle's readers' behalf to complete assignments atop the deadly combination of uncomfortable stools and claustrophobic desktops in the future. As of right now, I’m steering clear of it all. I saw it once, and I don’t have to see it again.</p>",

This included wins over Hampton, UNC Wilmington, and William &amp; Mary, where the Dragons outscored their opponents by an average of 23.7 points, with their smallest margin of victory sitting at 15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dragons were by no means playing poorly prior to the start of conference play in the CAA, as they notched big victories over #18 ranked Villanova, as well as Winthrop and UAlbany, who both sit atop their respective conferences. However, the Dragons’ out of conference play lacked consistent offensive rhythm, which led to key momentum-killing losses to Big 5 opponents La Salle and Temple, as well as WVU and Bryant. Since the start of the new year, however, the Dragons have played at a much higher level, and fixed a large number of their flaws in their game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most obvious improvement has been the 3-point shooting, as Zach Spiker’s team has taken a huge step forward from a 28.9% shooting rate in the old year to an incredible 48.1% rate since. The improvement in shooting has not come from only one player, either, as Justin Moore, Mate Okros and Luke House are all shooting above 50% from beyond the arc in at least a dozen attempts each, all making great improvements over their 2023 shooting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel has even made improvements on their greatest strength in the first half, their defense, which held opponents to an average of 63.6 points per contest. Since CAA play began, however, the Dragons have held opponents to an average of 61 points per game, and only allowed a remarkable 34.7% shooting from the field, and 24.7% shooting from deep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dragons suffered a loss prior to conference play, as senior guard Lamar Oden Jr. went down with a lower body injury, but multiple players have stepped up to lessen the blow of his loss. Former walk-on Luke House, who has emerged as one of the Dragons top talents over the past two seasons, has been fantastic in conference games, shooting 62.5% from the field, 53.8% from 3-point, and scoring 13 points per game. Aside from House, sophomore guards Justin Moore and Kobe Magee have shot the ball much better, and contributed to Drexel’s rise in scoring over their first three conference matches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As conference play continues, it will be interesting to see if the Dragons can remain consistent with their improvements, and if it can lead them to a CAA Regular Season or CAA Tournament Title.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>After the attack on Oct. 7, President John Fry — just a day after the conflict — sent out a school-wide email, addressing the tragic event and his stance on the situation. Starting off bold and strong, President Fry stated, “I join with all of you in mourning the loss of innocent life…” And so on the letter went, affirming once again his alliance with suffering Israeli people, even sending his condolences to those who were facing great losses at the Gaza border at the time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>President Fry’s letter on the surface seems to be a sympathetic one – one that addresses the loss of Drexel’s colleagues, one that lends a shoulder to suffering family members, and one that speaks of great empathy to all students on campus. Yet, ironically, many people find his letter to be a slap in the face, a stain on the names of struggling Palestinians, and a direct contradiction of his own words: “mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n<p>Failing to mention the decades-long history of Palestine oppression prior to the conflict, President Fry has stirred anger among students, especially Muslims and Palestinians on campus. His letter, by only spreading sympathy to the State of Israel who has been constantly oppressing Palestine for the past 56 years, acted as the stimulus for students across campus to stand up and voice their own opinions.</p>\n<p>Starting with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CyPLrBDKZj1/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa\"><u>@drexelsjp</u></a>’s (Drexel Student for Justice Palestine) open letter to President Fry, more and more student organizations began to advocate for the innocent lives of Palestinians by directly criticizing President Fry’s statement as well as host protests across University City. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CyghkAPAoYv/?img_index=1\"><u>Drexel’s Muslim Student Association</u></a> has also taken their stance on the issue, directly vocalizing their support for Palestine. The Rush Building – home to Drexel’s Student Center for Diversity &amp; Inclusion – also hosted an event showing solidarity for Palestine by hanging up their flags around the area, marking the organization’s firm opposition to the on-going genocide in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amidst the outrage in response to his letter, Fry went on to send out three more emails, emphasizing his concern for students and faculty. In the second statement (sent out Oct. 11), Fry provided students with mental health resources and mentioned vaguely of “a line between expressing strong opinions through robust discussion, debate, and peaceful protest — and targeting any individual for discrimination, intimidation, or hate.” Though the matter was not made clear in this email, it was directly mentioned in President Fry’s third email (sent out Oct. 14) where he referred to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/drexel-dorm-anti-semitism-vandalism/3666052/\"><u>hate crime</u></a> performed against a Jewish student in Race Resident Hall. And it was not until his fourth and final email (sent out Oct. 20) that President Fry extended his “full sympathy and support to our Palestinian students, faculty, and professional staff, whose pain and trauma deepen by the hour as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and casualties rise.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>President Fry's response has undoubtedly caused more stir within students and faculties. Enraged by President Fry’s subtly biased statements, Drexel SJP went on to lead <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw4tOrJ6Z4/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa\"><u>a student walkout </u></a>in front of the Dragon Statue – Drexel’s famous mascot. Efforts to protest against universities’ support for Israel have also been heightened with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CywxQzZLili/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa&amp;img_index=1\"><u>national student walkouts </u></a>hosted by Drexel and UPenn. Student organizations, playing the role of courageous advocates, have strongly and firmly stated their voice within the community, further spreading awareness to other peers on campus. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>As for President Fry, it is difficult to say the same about him. From the very first statement, President Fry has infuriated many with his superficial and one-sided address regarding the conflict. It is careless, and extremely harmful, to mention the Oct.7 attack without referring to the five decades-long of constant torture and occupation of Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a historically-loose announcement, President Fry — intentionally or not — has opened the gate for many to wrongly perceive the situation, leading to conflicts intensified on both sides. The tense environment is portrayed so vividly on our own campus where Palestinians suffer the loss of representation, and at the same time, Jewish suffer the cause of hate crime invoked through peripheral historical understanding. Therefore, it is strongly and robustly the President’s job to be more cautious and careful with his own statements so that further cases of hate crime and student oppressions can be prevented.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it should not take a fire alarm ringing dreadingly at 1 a.m. or countless student walkouts for President Fry to understand his responsibilities as acting President of Drexel University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more context of the war, one can visit informative resources such as videos made by<a href=\"https://youtu.be/w5B9FBiFkQk?si=gShyNNIwnMwTb6dH\"><u> Johnny Harris</u></a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lv1SpwwJEW8?si=Pb_soLb5L-F2P41A\"><u>Vox</u></a> or educational material at <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/10/19/resources-palestinian-liberation/\"><u>PRISM</u></a>.

Organizations partook in the Shut It Down movement created by grassroots organizations such as the National Students for Justice in Palestine and the Palestinian Youth Movement. Attendance consisted of a diverse array of students, professors, and faculty, standing shoulder to shoulder, coming together for one purpose, to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. The atmosphere was charged with emotion and a sense of urgency as unified voices chanting phrases such as “1, 2, 3, 4, Occupation No More,” reflecting the protesters' demand for a free Palestine. Signs and banners among the sea of people stood tall, with messages such as “Ceasefire Now,” and “Protect Academic Freedom” on posters as individuals rallied in solidarity.</p>\n<p>The rally was aimed to address and speak out against the growing issue of doxxing and intimidation of student organizers that has recently been occurring on college campuses across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students and faculty of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania gathered to express their concern for the ongoing increase of intimidation and doxxing tactics, such as blacklisting. The rally consisted of three speakers, including speakers from UPenn, a grad student at Drexel, and a Drexel Professor.</p>\n<p>A speaker from UPenn attempted to empower the crowd, and encourage a mindset of strength and unity. The speaker communicated this by saying, “... their intimidation only works if we are intimidated by it. There are decades of student organizers that have come before us and millions of student organizers that we stand with now, and we will continue speaking out as long as it’s going on.”</p>\n<p>“Doxxing is not a new tactic. Leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Junior were doxxed and experienced incredible government surveillance,” stated another speaker at the protest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The speaker continued to list college campuses in the U.S. where anti-Palestinian acts have taken place to silence student voices. On Nov. 10, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4304627-columbia-suspends-student-group-palestine-jewish-israel-hamas/\"><u>Columbia University</u></a> suspended the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) campus organizations for the entirety of their fall semester. This occurred after hundreds of Columbia students participated in a campus-wide walkout calling for a cease-fire, hosted by the two groups the day before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am scared for the safety of my friends and myself only because we are speaking out against the genocide,” claimed a speaker concerned about doxxing.</p>\n<p>“Shame!” the crowd responded.</p>\n<p>Following the last speaker, protesters marched in unison to City Hall to join a &nbsp;larger-scale pro-Palestinian protest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an interview with The Triangle, a third-year Palestinian-American student at Drexel, who asked to remain anonymous due to the potential risk of facing consequences, expressed their concerns about being Muslim and Palestinian on campus recently.</p>\n<p>“I am scared, and frightened while being on campus as a visible Muslim. Being able to be identified in a crowd, or even walking alone is terrifying, just having to think that I will be the next victim, the next person to be attacked, judged, and mistreated for being who I am. Knowing that I am a visible Muslim puts not only me but also my career at risk. Knowing that some companies won’t hire me for what I believe in is unjust and unfair and knowing that I cannot change that makes me feel helpless, and also makes me lose motivation in trying to achieve all the goals that I have set for myself.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they felt about the intimidation tactics that are being used on students who voice their opinions, they responded,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am only in the design industry, so I stand by my work, and I stand for who I am. However, I do have anxiety about where my career is going to head not knowing if certain companies will accept me, not knowing if I’ll even make it being a designer because of who I am even though I am standing for what is right. But those who have to work for larger companies like working in the Medical field, are at a super high risk. I’ve spoken to at least three people who had to disassociate from who they are just so they can continue their studies. I know someone personally who’s in their third year of residency and hasn’t been able to speak up about what’s going on in Palestine, although he was born and raised there, in fear of being fired because someone they know already has been.”</p>\n<p>College campuses should be safe spaces for students of all races, ethnicities, and religions to voice their opinions. Students have a right to use their voices without the fear of being reprimanded or silenced for their beliefs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/drexel-community-comes-together-in-vigil-for-palestine/\"><u>Vigil for Palestine</u></a> that was hosted by the<a href=\"https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/mena\"><u> Middle Eastern and North African</u></a> (MENA) club on Nov. 9, a student claimed, “I attended the vigil with my friends, and in the middle of a speech this other student walked up to us, pulled out his phone to record us, and then proceeded to leave.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Capturing and filming individuals is a known doxxing and intimidation tactic that is being used on pro-Palestinian students. By exposing their identities and political affiliations, it can be used as a weapon against students to threaten them, potentially compromising their academic and professional aspirations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is the duty of colleges to protect their student's privacy and eliminate any prejudices that may harm a student. Drexel’s co-op interview selection process is the reason for many students' silence on sensitive issues. Students fear that there may be biases towards certain applicants due to their political beliefs. This fear must be eradicated. Drexel must foster an inclusive and unbiased environment that allows students to openly discuss their stance on issues without fear of repercussions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As members of the new generation, college students have a right and responsibility to speak on events that will shape their futures. Therefore, it is imperative that they use their voices, advocate for their beliefs, and never remain silent.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>College, branded as a time for education but also self-discovery and freedom, can become damaging without the proper tools for success. A poll taken by the <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/education/509231/college-students-experience-high-levels-worry-stress.aspx\"><u>Gallup and the Lumina Foundation</u></a> in March 2023 reported that out of 2,400 college students, 66% were experiencing stress and 51% reported “feelings of worry during a lot of the day.” Additionally, they also found that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/472247/emotional-stress-students-covid.aspx\"><u>emotional stress was reported to be one of the main reasons students considered dropping out in the fall 2022 semester.</u></a> A niche community of college students, who are very involved with the music, film and arts aspects of education is at great risk of experiencing mental health issues as well. <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>A recent survey</u></a> of 1500 independent musicians found that “73% have symptoms of mental health illness.” The individual needs of diverse communities like artists and musicians require solutions customized to their interests and individual needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Emily “Noa” Silverman, a Junior in Graphic Design and graphic designer for the Drexel Theater Company, spoke about how though she herself has employed good practices of stress relief such as drawing in her personal time, many of her friends in Fashion Design have felt academic pressure due to the fast pace of Drexel with little support from educators. Noa later spoke about how this affects the community on campus, mentioning how “we also don’t really have a community-based culture here, it’s all very work-oriented.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Speaking with a second-year fashion design student, who chose to remain anonymous, it was evident that artistic mediums like making music and drawing were significant stress relievers for her. She emphasized the importance of expressing her creativity amongst the rigorous nature of her major, especially considering the extremely fast-paced nature of the Drexel quarter system. “For things not involving my degree, [the arts] are an outlet of expressionism for which I have no limitations. When feeling overwhelmed, it’s nice to have something to put your thoughts out to see for yourself.” She is not alone in this sentiment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>In a research review</u></a>, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) detailed the surprising implications that music exposure had on human well-being. Specifically, an analysis of music therapy showed it to have an “overall beneficial effect on stress-related outcomes” and be a useful tool to address serious mental health concerns and substance abuse issues. It is also important to consider other forms of arts, film, and entertainment categories that may be useful tools for addressing mental health issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stevie Vagio, a freshman film and television major, is very involved with the arts and entertainment scene at Drexel. Taking lots of film classes and doing hands-on projects in the field, Vagio provided interesting insights into the unique mental health struggle experienced by people in his major/field. “Once in a while, I do feel burnt out due to the creativity demanded of my major” he says, bringing up an intriguing point. Whereas a biology or engineering major may feel mental health challenges in the form of stress or anxiety over their workload, a film and television major struggles in a different way: creatively. Creative burnout, <a href=\"https://www.idsa.org/wp-content/uploads/Creative%20Burnout%20-%20Suffocating%20The%20Future%20Of%20Design.pdf\"><u>as described by the Industrial Design Society of America</u></a>, can loosely be defined as the loss of the ability to creatively generate or express ideas, things that are certainly a focal point of any individual pursuing a degree or career in the arts or entertainment industry. Creative burnout is “a major inhibitor for creative individuals that is often overlooked or dismissed” and should certainly be considered in the context of a college education. Vagio had a notable solution to creative burnout and other mental health issues of arts and entertainment involving students. “Having opportunities to submit films conveying their own mental health problems” could provide a unique outlet for students involved in film to relieve their stress and address their mental health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Micheal Messina, junior film and television major, member of the Drexel Entrepreneurial Game Studio, and Producer, also mentions the stress that can come with doing projects in such a collaborative program. He notes “A lot of people are willing to work with you if you reach out to them, but I think that [educators] could do a better job at helping people who are not as comfortable reaching out to professors and students in general by maybe adding us all to a portal or somewhere where we can speak to each other that way.” Messina also mentioned the cultivation of student projects and how those greatly can affect one's feelings about themselves and the program, as these projects allow for personal expression and creativity in a way that assignments might not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cat LeFebvre, a freshman undecided design major, also had interesting insights into the issues and interventions applicable to students in her field. Whereas Vagio was more focused on the film and media aspects of arts and entertainment, LeFebvre discussed thefine arts aspect of the field. While LeFebvre agreed with Vagio about the risk of creative burnout, she also emphasized the importance of finding an art medium as a stress outlet that was “soothing, had reduced pressure and emphasized more of the work and less of the stress.” She described her personal experiences doing physical things with her hands to assist her mental health, some examples of such tasks being sketching and drawing on her notes. While she did mention art clubs and other student organizations that put on art therapy events such as drawing nights and t-shirt making, LeFebvre stressed the need for more Drexel-sponsored events (that are not club events) to support mental health, especially during final exams. “Little things like jazz nights and drawing nights can be something to consider. They don’t have to be big; they just have to be effective.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The points made by LeFebvre brought up another aspect of arts and entertainment mental health interventions that can be overlooked: the accessibility of the programs. Freshman Graphic Design major, Sarah Bonsall, has had her own mental health struggles but had some interesting perspectives on potential university-wide interventions for them. “It would be cool to have university-wide events or things in the dorm that are easily accessible.” She went on to describe the Westphal and graphic design schools as putting a large emphasis on mental health without ensuring that the resources are easily accessible. “Professors can send students emails with steps that we can take to improve our mental health. Even an information session during Welcome Week [with mental health resources and techniques for Westphal and design majors] would be helpful.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Acknowledging the important role that stress, burnout, exhaustion and other forms of mental health issues have on human wellbeing, the Central Federal Association of the Public Health Insurance Funds in Germany allocates funds to &nbsp;Creative Arts Therapies (CATs). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836011/\"><u>A scientific review published in 2018</u></a> describes CATs as being an intervention that “encompass[es] art, music, dance/movement, and drama therapy as their four major modalities” to approach individuals creatively and nonverbally. Notably, CATs differ from traditional forms of therapy by constantly encouraging clients to create/generate. This unique approach to utilizing the creative arts to address mental health challenges is definitely applicable in the context of the Drexel system.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/76449/How%20Art%20Therapy%20Can%20Assist%20College%20Students%20from%20Diverse%20Backgrounds%20in%20Overcoming%20Cultural%20Differences.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>University of Wisconsin</u></a>, the Student Health and Counseling Services adopted the practice of art therapy to support the wellbeing of the students in attendance. Their studies found that art therapy was incredibly beneficial to students, especially those who were undergoing culture shock from being in a different country or those who could not express themselves as freely. Many found that CAT was a successful relief, as it allowed a new medium to express emotions. Having scheduled events throughout the term, especially during times when students are experiencing high levels of stress (such as midterms and finals) may prove to be especially beneficial, especially to students who generally strive to employ the use of art, film, media and beyond as therapy. &nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Champagne Papi, the 6 God, Aubrey, the Boy, Wheelchair Jimmy, Mr. October, October’s Very Own, Heartbreak Drizzy or the artist best known as Drake has returned from a nearly year-long absence with his 8th studio album, \"For All the Dogs.\" Having been teased from the beginning of the year, as well as during his tour, the album was finally confirmed in mid-July through Drake’s poetry book. Featured at the end of the book is a QR code that led fans to a website announcing that an album was on the way, along with the quote “They say they miss the old Drake, girl don’t tempt me,” a lyric from Drake’s 2011 hit “Headlines.”</p>\n<p>What Drake meant by “the old Drake” is left unclear. Did he mean he was going back to his original, early 2010s style? This version of melodic rap was a style that on the one hand put him on the map, but also gave him a reputation as an overly-sensitive young man, which definitely gave Drake some enemies early in his career. Or is he referring to the style he adopted in the latter part of the decade, which included heavily trap-inspired instrumentals, and a shift in topics from women and relationships to more flexing, as well as detailing violence in his community?</p>\n<p>This question would begin to be answered with the release of the album’s first single, “Slime You Out,” featuring first-time collaborator but long-time “friend” SZA. Just from this song alone, it seems as though Drake is leaning heavily towards that early 2010s style, with the passionate and melodic Drake vocals reflective of his work on \"Take Care\"<i> </i>and \"Nothing Was the Same.\" In terms of the actual quality of the song, this was definitely a solid effort, with both Drake and &nbsp;SZA contributing quality verses. Despite an interesting, poetry-style outro, the song was pretty good and set the tone for what one should expect from the album.</p>\n<p>However, any expectations were thrown out the window just a few weeks later, when the day before the album’s release, Drake released another single, “8 am in Charlotte.” As the newest installment in his “time and place” series, many expected the song to feature heavy lyricism, but as soon as the “Conductor” producer tag was heard, it became clear that this song was something else entirely. He adapts to the style of one of modern boom bap’s biggest producers and goes for four and a half minutes straight of some of his best bars to date. For example, “so many checks owed I feel Czheckoslovakian.” Need I say more?</p>\n<p>The next morning, the album was finally released, and only more questions were raised as to what was meant by “the old Drake.” Starting off with the album’s intro “Virginia Beach,” which is definitely an “old Drake” song. With a Frank Ocean sample on a beat produced by one of Drake’s closest confidants, OVO 40, there are some very clear signs of vintage Drake throughout the song. This continues with the next two songs, with Drake’s verses on both featuring him lamenting a past love, something he has been known for doing since the beginning of his career.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there is a clear shift for the next three songs, with all of them being more trap-focused, one of them even being produced by legendary trap producer Southside. Overall, all great songs, especially his collaborative effort with J. Cole, “First person Shooter,” which features both artists discussing their current status in the rap game. Besides demonstrating a clear shift in sound, these songs also mark a change in theme, with all three discussing money, fame, and “standing on business,” themes that have become synonymous with Drake’s more recent work.</p>\n<p>However, no song on the album shows such a drastic shift sonically as much as “IDGAF,” a collaborative effort with newcomer Yeat. Despite Yeat being listed as the feature, he is undoubtedly the one who carries the song. Produced by Yeat’s long-time collaborator BNYX, the song doesn’t stray away from his traditional style, and it is up to Drake to adapt to that, which he does extremely well. Following this song, there is another shift in tone, in which Drake proceeds to autocroon throughout the next six songs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Besides a respectable DJ Screw tribute and some solid moments on the tracks, they are few and far between, and the overall remarkably boring stretch of the album leaves fans wondering why it was included in the first place. Drake quickly changes pace with the Lil Yachty-produced “What Would Pluto Do?” a tribute to another one of his long-time collaborators, Future. Yachty’s influence on the track is very evident, and aside from his ad-libs after every line, he has stamps all over the song, almost as if it was Drake simply just performing one of Yachty’s songs. This shift in energy is quickly halted with the next song “All The Parties,” another slow, uneventful track that completely wastes a Chief Keef verse, something that is very hard to come by.</p>\n<p>The album continues with collaborations with Bad Bunny, Sexy Redd and an actual feature from Yachty, with each song leaning towards the styles of its respective features, rather than Drake sticking to his own unique style. However, these are some of the most interesting, unique songs off the album, with each song seemingly not taking itself too seriously, allowing for Drake and his collaborators to simply have fun with it, and make something exciting for the fans. The album’s conclusion includes a compelling look back at Drake’s come-up with “Away from Home,” but the final song, “Polar Opposites,” is yet another drawn-out track featuring a melodic Drake talking about another past relationship. However, is this what he meant by “the old Drake?” These are the kinds of songs that made Drake who he is, but is that all in the past now? Will there be another “Marvin’s Room” or “Best I Ever Had?” Most likely not. At the time, that kind of music was new, especially in a rap game that was just getting over the gangster rap era. That period is completely different from what is happening today, where nearly every artist is influenced by Drake in some way. At the end of the day, people get tired of the same old thing, and every artist, Drake included, needs to adapt in some way. If <i>For All the Dogs</i> is any indication, he has found a way to do that, and if that includes “borrowing” other artists’ styles and hopping on their waves, then more power to him.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>\"The hit HBO Max series \"Euphoria\" has done a lot for its stars. Jacob Elordi has had a banner year, doing a killer job portraying Elvis in Sofia Coppola’s \"Priscilla\"<i> </i>(2023) and also starring in Emerald Fennell’s \"Saltburn<i>\" </i>(2023) with Barry Keoghan. Alexie Demie had a phenomenal turn back in 2019 starring in Trey Edward Shults’ \"Waves<i>,\" </i>with Kelvin Harrison Jr. and another recent breakout, Taylor Russell. Hunter Schafer has modeled for various prominent fashion brands as well as being the highlight of the new Hunger Games movie, \"The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\"<i> </i>(2023). Zendaya is, well, Zendaya. She is soon to be featured in Luca Guadagnino’s (Director of Call Me By Your Name,\" \"Bones and All\") \"Challengers,\" a love triangle film set against the world of pro-tennis, co-starring Mike Faist and former Prince Charles actor Josh O’Connor. Other than that, she’s rumored to be the star of a Cleopatra Film directed by Denis Villeneuve (Director of \"Dune\"<i> </i>(2021)) that may also feature Timothee Chalamet and Daniel Craig. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>That being said, I think it’s a pretty terrible, offensive and not terribly complex show.</p>\n<p>Greg Arraki, a filmmaker that was big with the indie wave of LGBTQ films, spoke of \"Euphoria\" in a recent interview with Richard Linklater. Compared to his earlier works, he said “It’s a fun time as opposed to something like ‘Euphoria,’ which is the sex and the drugs and the nihilism and all that, but it’s miserable. There’s no joy.” Arraki’s comment makes me think of the oft-used term “misery porn” or “trauma porn,” which I see as a story that starts and ends tragically, and often exists seemingly just to provoke a reaction among its audience. There’s often not any sort of closure, catharsis, or even lesson. To me, that’s Sam Levinson’s specialty. Euphoria\" doesn’t seem to follow any consistent plot, which I think may be due to the fact that it was one of the only shows on television that didn’t have a writer’s room. Sam Levinson was the sole creative authority, could change plot lines or scripts up until the last minute (which he, reportedly, often did), and even ended up cutting characters if he didn’t get along with the actors (see: Barbie Ferrera). You would get a phenomenal episode like “Stand Still Like The Hummingbird” in season 2 episode 5 - essentially an adrenaline-filled long take with Rue on the run from her friends and family – that would seemingly have major implications for the plot, and yet the next episode would focus on a different character and act like the previous episode didn’t happen. There are all these consequential events that Levinson doesn’t have time to wrap up in the finale, yet he does somehow have time to let Dominic Fike sing for a three-and-a-half minutes and show a premiere of Lexi’s play that nobody had heard about until an episode or two prior.</p>\n<p>My biggest problem with the show - other than the fact that it manages to be a cautionary tale about drug use while, at the same time, glorifying drugs - &nbsp;is that it’s misery for misery’s sake. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I find that with shows and films that deal with tragedy, the difference between great and derivative often comes down to whether the good times are at all highlighted. If you dedicate time to a character’s rise, or spend time establishing their joys, things they hold dear, the loss of those things hits harder. If you show a character starting out in a state of misery and then just keep punishing them, as is the case with \"Euphoria\", it numbs you out more than anything else. I’ve been sober for a good amount of time now, but the state of my life in active addiction was nothing short of miserable. I wouldn’t leave my apartment for weeks at a time, the symptoms of my mental illness were heightened because of the substances I was using, I had problems with basic hygiene, and I was completely disconnected from my entire support system. It’s a state of being that I wouldn’t wish on anybody, no matter how bad they may have wronged me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>That being said, the thing that \"Euphoria\" misses is that during any time in many an addict’s life, there was a time where they were having fun. I know that must sound pretty wild to say, me trying to distinguish that there was a part of active addiction that was enjoyable, but it’s the truth. There is a period, before substances stop doing the trick and the use gets out of control, where you have the illusion that your problem is being solved, that substances are alleviating the problem and not making it worse. My active addiction wasn’t all misery, if it was it probably wouldn’t have taken me nearly as long to quit using drugs and alcohol. There were times where I was still tolerable around some of my closest friends, where I was fun, funny, and not as ill-tempered, and those are memories that I wouldn’t exchange for anything. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I imagine I’m starting to sound outlandish, but my point with this is you never really get to see Rue having any fun. You’re inundated with knowledge about her tragedies – often the same information repeatedly – like the loss of her father. You watch her break her relationships with her closest friends and her family much more often than you get a chance to see her build them back up. You watch her relapse, over and over and over. You never really get to relish in Rue <i>having </i>something, or taking in any sort of victory. One doesn’t know much about what Rue may have enjoyed in the time before she lost herself to addiction. For example, it seems she has known Lexi for many years. If they have stayed friends to this day in spite of Rue’s problems with addiction, I assume there must have been a period where that relationship was pretty great. What of that? What about the early years of her relationship with her sister, not to speak of the great years she must have shared with her father in the years before his death? When all you see is Rue losing without a resolute picture of what she had, it’s hard to feel much of anything at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Thanksgiving break is typically a time for togetherness and gratitude, a social gathering that college students all around the country look forward to, yearning to spend quality time with their friends and loved ones. For my friend Kinnan Abdalhamid and his good friends, Hisham Awartani and Tahseen Ali Ahmedit, the holiday weekend was anything but such.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 25, Kinnan and his friends, all Palestinian-American college students, were in Burlington, Vermont for the holidays. Walking down the street together, two were wearing keffiyehs (Palestinian scarves) and all three spoke a mixture of Arabic and English. Unprovoked, the three were brutally shot by Jason J. Eaton, 49, two in the torso and one in the lower extremities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This incident, sadly, is nothing new to our violence-seasoned generation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abdalhamid and I were students together in an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training course this past year. From every interaction I had with him, I was consistently impressed at the passion and competency he brought to mastering every skill necessary to become an EMT, to save the lives of the very people who seem to hate the Palestinian culture he represents. As an aspiring doctor, he has proved without a doubt that he will become an empathetic, competent physician, someone who will make an impact in whatever community he chooses to serve. I am sure that the aspirations of Awartani and Ali Ahmedit reflect that same sentiment, one of fearless courage, dreams, and unwavering determination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are three promising college students, the same age as many of us, fearlessly living their lives and representing their culture, only to be permanently scarred as a result of it. What happened to them is no more but a stark reminder of the prejudice and intolerance that consistently persists in our society, a bigger issue that is something that needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Israel-Palestine conflict is a long standing geopolitical issue, the repercussions of which have been reaching far and beyond its borders, something that is becoming increasingly common in our globalized world. The United States especially faces a grim reality in this sense; somehow, speaking a different language or simply wearing your cultural attire can make you a target for violence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the FBI’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crs/highlights/2022-hate-crime-statistics\"><u>2022 hate crime statistics report</u></a>, In the year 2022 alone, of the 2,042 reported incidents based on religion, “more than half of these (1,122) were driven by anti-Jewish bias [...] and 158 involving anti-Muslim [sentiment].” These statistics, being as horrific as they all, should serve as a wakeup call to us. We are the “woke generation” after all, so let's start acting like it. It all comes down to a few simple facts. First, understanding the problem. Given the overwhelming amount of information that we process about every single event around the world online and offline, it becomes important to be aware of the truly factually correct information about a situation. So before we become one of the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2016/12/15/many-americans-believe-fake-news-is-sowing-confusion/\"><u>23% of Americans</u></a> sharing fake news, let us make sure we factually verify what we see before we send it out into the world. Second, not acting on our own preconceived notions about a person or group of people. We are all human beings, with hopes, dreams and ambitions. Every person, regardless of their race, gender, religion or prominent differences should have the right to freely live their life without facing the discrimination of others. <br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>If you have TikTok or Instagram, odds are you have heard of \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Originally released in 2017, the novel took the world by storm on “BookTok” in 2022. It follows the story of Evelyn Hugo, a beautiful and talented movie star who rose to fame for her acting and extensive dating history.</p>\n<p>Evelyn, now in her seventies, had been evading the public eye for quite some time. One day, she requested Monique Grant, an up-and-coming reporter, to write her last testimony. Monique accepted the task, but was confused on why Evelyn chose her of all writers. The novel reflects on Evelyn’s lifetime, from her famous husbands to her secret love affairs and everything in between. Taking place over a few days, Monique and Evelyn bond as they learn more about one another and why people make the choices that they do. The book explores themes of love and loss, with a twist that will leave readers speechless.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Reid released \"Daisy Jones and the Six<i>.\" </i>The novel follows the story of a singer named Daisy Jones, a band called The Six, and all the drama that ensues when they are forced to work together. The book is written in screenplay format, as an unknown interviewer asks Daisy, the members of The Six, and their closest friends to explain what happened during the band’s epic career. The book focuses heavily on the lead singer of The Six, Billy Dunne. Billy was a big shot from Pittsburgh who believed he could make it in Hollywood. Alongside his brother, Graham, his girlfriend, Camila, and the rest of the band, Billy lands the group a record deal that changes everything. Daisy Jones, born to celebrity parents who neglected her, made her own way in the world of music. When The Six’s producer decides to invite Daisy to sing on a track, the chemistry is undeniable. The chemistry in the music, and the chemistry with none other than Billy Dunne. The band must navigate through lover’s quarrels, drug addictions, and the stress of writing number one albums without falling apart. As the group looks back on the time in their life, pieces of who Daisy Jones and The Six really were begin to come together.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Reid released \"Malibu Rising.\" The novel encapsulates the lives of the Riva family. Switching between testimonies from the past and the present, Reid explains how the parents, Mick and June Riva, met and married in the fifties, while also showing how their children live in the Eighties, present day in the book. The Riva children are all talented in their own right. Jay surfs, Hud is a photographer, Kit is a dedicated student, and Nina is a surfer and model. However, the family comes with their own set of issues. Nina was left by her husband, pro tennis player Brandon Randall. Hud is in love with Jay’s ex-girlfriend. Kit feels inferior to her siblings. Mick and June are nowhere to be found. Worse yet, they all have to keep appearances together for the limelight. The present piece of the story takes place very rapidly, as the family prepares for the annual party at Nina’s house that draws celebrities from every corner of Hollywood. The book follows the sibling drama and what happens when Malibu burns.</p>\n<p>The last book released by Reid was \"Carrie Soto is Back\" in 2022. Carrie is a tennis player, and not just any player, she is the best. She set records for women’s tennis under the coaching of her father, Javier. Carrie places her identity in the thrill of the sport, which comes crashing down after an injury that leads to retirement. Carrie becomes even more devastated when a new player, Nicki Chan, breaks her win record. Carrie decides to leave retirement to claim her title once again. She goes on a remarkable journey full of friendship, loss, discovery, and joy as she sees the world outside the realm of tennis for the first time. The book truly captures what it means to face adversity and not back down.</p>\n<p>Though these books may seem like simple stories of Hollywood glitz and glam, they are actually woven together in the same universe. Though many characters make quick cameos or are mentioned briefly, one man connects them all: Mick Riva. Mick is introduced in detail during the novel about his family, Malibu Rising. It is where audiences learn about his rise to fame. Mick is also present in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, as one of Evelyn’s husbands and is mentioned in <i>Daisy Jones and The Six </i>as a famous singer. In Carrie Soto is Back, Carrie has an interest in Brandon Randall, the ex-husband of Mick’s daughter, Nina. Mick tying all the stories together takes the series from a few tales to an encompassing world. Knowing that all of the characters exist simultaneously and know one another allows the readers to form real connections with the people and understand them in a more complex light. The universe is given life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reid’s novels capture the ins and outs of Hollywood. From messy celebrity relationships to devastating secrets and everything in between, you find yourself drawn to the characters brought to life on the pages. She paints the pictures so well, and the dialogue and plot are both interesting and unpredictable. While each story can be read on its own, it is so exciting to piece together the elements from each book that relate to another book. If you are looking for good winter break reads, the Taylor Jenkins Reid Book Universe is a great place to start. Reid has said that the books can be read in any order with the connection points still making sense. As you weave your way through the mess of fame and the glamor and destruction that comes with it, you will find yourself falling in love with the compelling characters Reid puts on the page. If you do start this journey, you should pick up all four books at once. You won’t be able to put them down.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In the 1990’s, a schoolteacher named Mary Kay Letourneau had an affair with a seventh grader (twelve-year-old) she had previously taught. She had his first child in jail, and the two later started a family. This is the jumping off point of Todd Haynes’ new film “May December” (A May-December romance is one between two people with a considerable age difference), a film indebted to but not based off the nationwide scandal. The film takes a look at a fictional relationship between a couple twenty years after a similar scandal, with Julianne Moore and Charles Melton playing the couple (Gracie and Joe, respectively) and Natalie Portman playing Elizabeth Berry, a Juilliard-trained actress coming to study the family for a film based on their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the end, I had mixed feelings about the film. I had to sit on my thoughts for a few days before I could even think about writing on it, which is definitely the effect Haynes intended on. However one finds the pacing, the reason the film draws you in can best be phrased as the question Gracie’s first husband asks Elizabeth during a coffee sit-down: “what would make a thirty-six-year-old woman have an affair with a seventh grader?” Your mind spends the entirety of the film trying to find an answer to that question. To me, some of the most interesting films portray characters that are unknowable; we want so desperately to understand how they can do what they’re doing – whether they’re serial killers, sex offenders, even secret agents that manage to vanish amongst a crowd of people – so we continue watching in an effort to discern how these people work on the inside. Some of this material can be handled with a little less tact (see Ryan Murphy’s Dahmer show), but when done somewhat correctly you have a film that as digestible but at the same time confounding.</p>\n<p>One way that May December keeps your jaw perpetually dropped is through the campy tone that permeates every scene; I’m not joking, many a review mentions how this film intentionally plays out as your typical soapy melodrama. Every single detail having to do with their respective ages then becomes extremely jarring. That’s a part of the genius of the film, even if its commitment to camp eventually veers it away from a full exploration of the subject matter. This film, which is a glimpse at an inherently stunted relationship twenty years later, plays out as if it’s about any normal couple. In an early scene where the couple has Portman’s Elizabeth over for an introductory dinner – she's come to stay in town to study them – Gracie and Joe parse out whether it was in sixth or seventh grade that they “met,” as nonchalantly as if they were talking about the weather for the coming week. Joe waxes poetically about how much he’s going to miss his children as the youngest two head off for college, when in reality he looks more like an older brother to them than a father. At thirty-six years old, Joe is about to be an empty-nester. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key to this film working, at least as much as it does, is Charles Melton’s performance. I haven’t seen Riverdale – his biggest acting credit thus far – but I’d still bet my left hand that his turn in this film will surprise some people. Melton gained forty pounds for the role to play a pot-bellied, emotionally stunted empty-nester. To play Joe successfully, Melton had to nail the performance of a thirty-six-year-old father of three who is still twelve years old on the inside — a kid that, despite engaging in all of these consequential life decisions, may be less fully developed than those he fathered. Melton plays a character who, arguably, isn’t the main character in his own life. Joe was far too young to give consent at the start of what he still in the present perceives as a mutual affair; he asserts to Elizabeth in their first one-on-one conversation that “he wanted it.” Although Joe is purportedly an adult by now, Gracie still chastises him like a child if he has more than one beer, and he constantly has to comfort her through her temper tantrums. Melton’s character constantly advocates for Gracie, but never seems all too comfortable with her. Especially as the story goes on and Elizabeth probes deeper and deeper into how much he could’ve possibly consented to in what became a relationship of over two decades. Despite being a statue of a man, Melton’s nervous posture and hushed tone of voice signal the inner child desperately trying to claw its way out as much as his outward appearance knowingly tries to bury it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most jarring instances that highlights Melton’s performance, and serves as an example of how the film’s treating all past events in the film’s world as normal makes the experience more unnerving, is when Melton’s Joe is sitting on the roof of his home, thinking. His high school senior son, one of the two set to leave for college soon, comes out and sits next to him, initially not realizing that he’s there. Joe nervously tries to make small talk with a son who he knows will be leaving him soon, giving the typical parent spiel about how his kid is all grown up, affirming that he can visit home whenever he wants. In any other film this would be a normal – most likely boring – conversation, complete with the son nodding knowingly; “when is dad gonna shut up?” But you feel compelled to wonder if anyone else in the theater is seeing this right now, because while Joe has the candor of a typical father, he’s far from that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He’s a thirty-six-year-old man whose youngest child is about to leave for college, an experience he presumably never had the luxury of indulging in. Melton plays this entire scene perfectly straight, showing that Joe has for decades shoved down all the evidence we find irregular. The nail is driven even further down when Joe’s son asks if he’s going to be on the roof much longer; his son wants to smoke a joint. Joe, wanting to seem cool, tells his son to go ahead. It’s right then that you realize there was no point in the timeline in Joe’s life where he could have tried weed; Joe was in this relationship from when he was twelve years old on, Gracie probably even introduced him to alcohol. He awkwardly admits that he’s “never done that,” and soon after takes a puff. Joe then completely breaks down and laments about how much he loves his son, desperate to know that his son is aware he feels that way. After that, he almost falls off the roof. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>To me, May December is near perfect in all of these ways. The fact that it gives you this family to study and puts this work into depicting it is reason enough to watch alone. My only qualm is that it commits to the campiness so heavily – the same score is present in almost every other scene – that it never gets around to a conclusive dissection of how Gracie and Joe’s relationship is really doing in the present. There is a scene very late in the film where Joe, now awake to all these questions we as the audience have been asking, confronts Gracie about whether he may have been too young to fully consent. He laments, “If we’re really as in love as we say we are, why can’t we talk about it?” Gracie quickly shuts him down and asserts that he was in charge. It’s only towards the end that one wonders if twenty minutes could’ve been cut from depicting the seemingly banal day-to-day and put towards a more direct examination of the relationship at the heart of the story. Maybe it’s part of the point that said conversation is never finished, but we feel that same hunger for some sort of clarity that Joe does, and neither him nor us receive anything quite satisfying.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Each year, Dec.1 marks World AIDS Day — a day to raise awareness for the AIDS pandemic, remember individuals who have died from HIV and AIDS, show support for those currently living with HIV/AIDS and celebrate and encourage progress in developing prevention and treatment options.</p>\n<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted infection that is spread through bodily fluids like semen, vaginal or rectal fluids, breast milk and blood. It most often spreads through unprotected sex, but it can also spread through sharing needles; this is especially prevalent among the vulnerable population of individuals suffering with addictions to injection drugs (like heroin, opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine). It is not spread through mucus, saliva, or urine. An acute HIV infection — especially when left untreated — can develop into a chronic HIV infection and, in extreme cases, to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</p>\n<p>Many people have heard of HIV and AIDS, but not many understand what makes the infection and associated disease so dangerous. HIV is infamous for having an immensely effective infectious mechanism. The virus attacks CD4+ T cells — white blood cells that are critical to the body’s ability to fight infectious diseases. HIV is also a retrovirus, meaning that it utilizes a protein called reverse transcriptase to encode its own viral RNA into the DNA of the host cell. Building HIV’s genetic information into the genome of the infected cell like this is what allows HIV to hijack cellular machinery and multiply. As the infection progresses, CD4+ cells are destroyed and the body loses its ability to fight infection — this condition is characteristic of AIDS.</p>\n<p>In the past, HIV and AIDS were regarded as a death sentence. Educational resources regarding HIV and AIDS were scarce, and little was understood about the virus and disease. Many people thought there was nothing they could do to protect against or treat infection, but we now know this is untrue. Most importantly, we understand that using condoms, regularly getting tested for STIs and avoiding sharing needles are tremendously effective ways to prevent contracting HIV.</p>\n<p>As dangerous as the virus may be, there is also a &nbsp;multitude of treatment options available today for individuals who become infected with HIV. Although there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, treatments like Antireroviral Therapy (ART) — a regimen of medications — can prevent the infection from progressing and help infected individuals live healthy lives. In some cases, HIV treatment has even been so successful that it has reduced the viral load in a patient’s blood to an amount so low that they cannot transmit the infection to others.</p>\n<p>There are also medications that can reduce an individual’s chances of contracting HIV in the first place. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP, is a medication that can protect against HIV infection when taken soon after exposure to the virus — like after unprotected sex. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a similar medication that patients can take daily to reduce their risk of contracting HIV through sex by up to 99 percent. Some medications can even reduce the risk of contracting HIV through injection drug use by at least 74 percent.</p>\n<p>The AIDS pandemic has been a threat to public health around the world for decades. Perhaps most memorably, HIV infection swept through the United States in the 1980s and decimated the queer community, particularly in the New York City area. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids#:~:text=Globally%2C%2039.0%20million%20%5B33.1%E2%80%93,at%20the%20end%20of%202022.\"><u>World Health Organization</u></a> reports that an estimated 39 million people across the world are living with HIV, and it is well understood that HIV and AIDS disproportionately threaten underdeveloped and medically underserved communities.</p>\n<p>Understanding the amount that we do today about HIV transmission, disease prevention and sexual health, there are very few reasons that HIV and AIDS should continue to threaten those with access to comprehensive healthcare. However, stigma around the subject and a lack of resources prevent young sexually active people from being educated about HIV and AIDS. Many young people — most of whom are queer — become infected with HIV because they do not understand the options available to them and the strategies they can employ to reduce their risk of contracting the virus.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Today, remember the millions of people around the world who have died from HIV infection, celebrate the progress that has been made since the onset of the HIV/AIDS crisis, and understand how to protect yourself and others from HIV and AIDS. Young people should remember to use &nbsp;protection, get tested and consider if PrEP or PEP could be useful to you. HIV and AIDS are well understood, and with the tools of modern healthcare at its disposal our generation should be the one to finally end the HIV/AIDS crisis.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Video games have continued to grow in popularity since the invention of gaming consoles in the 1970s. For context, the television was invented in <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-television\"><u>1927</u></a>. The young age of the gaming industry has led to several questions regarding the impact of video games on mental health. Some people have used video games as scapegoats to explain mass shootings or other forms of violence despite <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748387407/video-games-are-still-blamed-for-gun-violence-despite-studies-showing-no-connect\"><u>minimal evidence proving that idea to be true</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With evidence suggesting a minimal impact on violent behaviors among those who play video games an alternative question must also be presented — do video games have a positive impact on our mental health? The idea that explicit media causes negative behavioral outcomes is nothing new. In the 1980s a large push by Tipper Gore, Al Gore’s wife and other Washington wives led to questions surrounding the influence of rock music on society. Gore and her allies believed that <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/regulating-violent-video-games-its-tipper-gore-versus-dee-snider-all-over-again/\"><u>violent media caused people to behave in violent ways after exposure to media containing drugs, sex, and violence</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As time went on, people who believed that music depicting violence was bad for society also developed the belief that violent video games must be equally harmful. Thus, a push to limit access to violent video games began. In 2005, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law a bill that banned the sale of violent video games to children in the state of California. This law would be struck down just half a decade later by the Supreme Court. In the 7-2 ruling the court decided that the law violated free speech and that <a href=\"https://ncac.org/news/blog/california-law-banning-sale-of-video-games-to-minors-ruled-unconstitutional#:~:text=The%20bill%2C%20originally%20signed%20into,retailers%20to%20label%20violent%20games\"><u>no substantial evidence existed to prove that violent video games caused violent behavior in real life</u></a>. In fact, many supporters of the gaming industry point to the fact that violence has actually decreased <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/murder-homicide-rate\"><u>from its peak in the early 1990s</u></a> when video games were nowhere near as popular as they are today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Adam Bilodeau, a Drexel Master’s in Public Health student and registered nurse, “Video games present a medium where college students can escape from reality and alleviate stress, often by venting their frustrations to trusted friends and members of a gaming community.” Bilodeau’s beliefs represent the consensus among Americans in a post-COVID society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theesa.com/news/nearly-all-americans-now-view-video-game-play-as-beneficial-following-covid-19-lockdowns/#:~:text=89%25%20of%20players%20say%20video,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202021\"><u>The Entertainment Software Association</u></a> stated, “89% of players say video games provide stress relief, while 88% say video games help improve cognitive skills.” Still, just because a group of people believes something to be true does not mean it is. <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.220411#d1e1255\"><u>Research published in the Royal Society last year</u></a> shows that the positive impact of video games on well-being is actually minimal. Video game addiction is another component of the industry that is being studied. Video games, like tobacco, alcohol, social media, or gambling, can become addictive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://americanaddictioncenters.org/video-gaming-addiction\"><u>According to American Addiction Center</u></a><u>s</u>, video game addiction can cause issues with concentration, aggression, and physical activity. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder\"><u>The World Health Organization</u></a> has acknowledged the existence of addiction to video games, calling it a “gaming disorder.” They state that in order for someone to be diagnosed with gaming disorder the user of video games must exhibit behaviors that impair interaction with friends and family, or interfere with the ability of the video game player to do work or school activities.</p>\n<p>Video games remain a relatively new medium, and research is still determining what effect they have on us, if one exists at all. Many people were scared of video games when they first became popular because of the lack of information about them. Now, after decades of research, the consensus may be that video games have little positive or negative impact on our mental health at all. In that regard, it may not be long before we view video games the same way we view music or shows on TV — just another way to pass the time and escape from the harsh realities of everyday life.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Drexel did the impossible and dethroned the mighty Villanova Wildcats in a cutthroat game that ended 57-55. The game took place at the Wells Fargo Center with stands full of navy and gold.</p>\n<p>The two teams matched up in the Big 5 consolation match, and since Villanova’s two big losses this year were against the Big 5 teams, UPenn and St. Joe’s, both teams entered the game winless in Big 5 play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Villanova, ranked 18th in the country, entered the day with an impressive 6-2 record, while Drexel sat at a respectable 4-3. Villanova was a 10.5 point favorite entering the game per ESPN, and Drexel, unfortunately, was not given a shot.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s highly ranked defense was on full display right away as they put up a tight knit defense, making sure Villanova could not score. And that they did as they held Villanova scoreless through the first three minutes, with Drexel star forward Amari Williams recording two blocks in the early stages of the game, one of the more notable blocks being against Villanova’s own Justin Moore.</p>\n<p>Although it was a low scoring affair for the majority of the game, the Dragons had multiple impressive offensive possessions that allowed them to move the ball well and run out the clock. From early in the game, the Dragons shot well from the deep. However, it wasn’t the usual Williams and Moore led offense early on, as neither had attempted a shot through a majority of the first quarter. Both Luke House and Lamar Oden Jr. were big contributors. Luke House nailed two three-pointers and had eight first half points and Oden made five points within the first half.</p>\n<p>At half, the Dragons led by only a point, 26-25. Villanova forward Eric Dixon was fouled on a successful three point shot which became a four point play at the end of the half.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dragons started off the second half with the ball in their possession and a quick three by Yame Butler. The second half then saw the Dragons go up as much as eight at points as they continued their strong play on both ends of the court. Drexel also stepped up their rebounding game in the second half of the game with a few rebounds being made to prevent the Wildcats from getting possession of the ball. However, slowly, the Wildcats were able to fight back to a 57-55 score with under a minute to play.</p>\n<p>With 31.3 seconds remaining, Drexel ran a strong press on Villanova, and trapped Junior Guard Jordan Longino. With 6.7 seconds left and struggling to get anything moving on the offensive side, Villanova coach Kyle Neptune called a timeout, which was followed by a play to get their star guard Justin Moore the ball. Moore attempted to fight through and put up a layup, but was blocked by Amari Williams in an exciting finish that drew a roar of cheers from the Drexel stands.</p>\n<p>It was a defensive master class from Drexel, holding the number eighteen school in the country to only 55 points, and holding arguably Villanova’s best scorer, Justin Moore, to 4 points on 1/11 shooting from the field. The Wildcats as a team shot a rough 32.8% from the field and 18.5% from beyond the arc, another testament to the Dragons strong defensive showing. &nbsp;One of the biggest improvements for the Dragons, and an aspect that allowed them to win the game was the three point shooting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Luke House was one of these shooters who caught the attention of the crowd by dropping several impressive threes. Entering the night the Dragons were shooting an abysmal 23.8% from three, but shot 50% in the contest against Villanova.</p>\n<p>Amari Williams, Drexel’s 6 '10 \" senior, finished the day with an impressive five blocks, as well as six rebounds, and led the team with twelve points. His major task for the night was guarding Eric Dixon, Villanova’s star player of the night, who although finished the day with a big 21 out of their 55 points, was stopped on multiple clutch occasions by Williams. When asked about the challenge of guarding Dixon, Williams acknowledged that “you don’t really get to play a big like him everyday.”</p>\n<p>On top of the very impressive victory of beating a ranked team, the historical implications of the game should not be understated. It was only the second time Drexel has beat Villanova (Villanova holds an impressive all-time 18-2 lead in their matchups), with the only other win being in 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On top of this Drexel earned their first ever win in the Big 5. “This is exactly what those who decided to make this event happen envisioned, and that is a great day for Philadelphia basketball,” said Drexel Coach Zach Spiker, who was in a state of excitement following one of the biggest wins of his career.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Alpha Tau Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity was officially reinstated and opened to housing brothers at Drexel University on Nov. 4.</p>\n<p>Previously, the chapter was reopened as an “expansion group” in Jan. 2022 according to Noah Apteker, the current president of TKE.</p>\n<p>The temporary suspension of TKE was placed in May 2017, according to an official statement from Drexel University to <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/tke-suspended-five-years/\">The Triangle</a>: \"<i>The Alpha Tau Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity has been sanctioned through the University’s Student Conduct process for failure to comply with the University’s alcohol policy and regulations with a five-year suspension of recognition. The decision was made after considering the chapter’s risk management deficiencies.\" </i>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A review of TKE's history on campus prior to the suspension can be found in a previous article from <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/tke-reviewing-recent-years/\">The Triangle</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Apteker, “the issue emerged in 2017, [and] along with the members involved at the time, are now firmly in the past.”</p>\n<p>During the suspension, the chapter was required to meet various criteria, including building a membership of at least 40 young men, all of which had to exceed the average GPA of a Drexel student, which was 3.7, according to former president Thomas Scanlin. Additionally, the chapter had to show their ability to provide for the chapter financially.</p>\n<p>During the developmental phase of reinstating the chapter, there was no access to the TKE house, instead, they held meetings in the homes of future brothers. Furthermore, all who were involved had no previous experience in Greek life nor had any connections to any other TKE chapters. Despite their challenges, the chapter made their first appearance at Night on the Row, Drexel's biggest night for recruitment according to former president Thomas Scanlin, where they were able to recruit 14 new brothers, nearly tripling their initial size.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their motto, “Better men for a better world” is something they held close to during recruitment, according to both Apteker and Scanlin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Due the the infancy of the chapter, the recruitment process is evolving with the chapter. As of now, the recruitment process consists of four to five events where brothers mingle and get to know potenial new members. After these events, the current brothers host a bid dinner where they extend an offer to PNM’s. These offers are only extended to those who stood out during the recruitment process and the current brothers feel would be a good fit for the chapter. Further, new members must comply with anti-hazing policies and prevention of sexual assault and drug use policies provided by Drexel and TKE headquarters.</p>\n<p>When asked what has been most exciting about being a part of the reinstatement of this chapter, Apteker said, “Watching the organization go from a random group of guys, to a close brotherhood. Everyone in TKE has become extremely close and we have created so many memories that will last a lifetime.”</p>\n<p>TKE’s new positive reputation not only reflects on the chapter, but on Drexel as a whole as they have become more involved with the community. One of TKE’s most exciting events is an annual philanthropy event: a St. Jude fundraiser where Philadelphia Eagles players visit the brothers at the TKE house for a meet and greet. Last year, TKE had the pleasure of having Brandon Graham, the current Philadelphia Eagles defensive end.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further, TKE is involved in DragonThon with Drexel Dance Marathon, where students raise money for children with life-threatening illnesses. Specifically, TKE hosts events and fundraisers for their Miracle Kid, Aaron.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there is still concern over the chapter's reputation.</p>\n<p>When asked how the chapter planned on correcting the mistakes made by the brothers in 2017, Scanlin said, “The new body has taken the responsibility of rebranding what it means to be a TKE. With that being said, we have made a huge effort to build healthy relationships with our fellow fraternities and sororities through social and philanthropy events. Additionally, we have worked hard to maintain good standing with IFC by attending events, contributing to the Greek community, and complying with all of their rules and guidelines.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although this chapter has only recently re-opened its doors to new members, TKE Alpha Tau was originally established at Drexel in 1939.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are interested in joining Greek Life or the TKE Alpha Tau chapter, reach out to TKE’s recruitment chair Julian Pittaoulis. The chapter is also reachable on their Instagram @ tke_drexel or at future rush events.<br/>\n</p>",

Drexel competed against 12 different schools, including the United Naval Academy and George Washington University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DU started off strong on the first day of the competition, which consisted of the Prelims (500 free, 200IM and 50 free), the Finals (200 Free Relay, 500 Free, 200IM, 50 Free and 400 Medley Relay) and Diving (1m Prelims and Finals). Taking home the silver medal, Drexel Men's 400 medley relay team, consisting of swimmers Dimi Gkelis, Kacper Karnik, Jakub Kwasny and Sebastian Smith seized second place at a time of 3:13.88. Smith and Kwasny also took fourth place in the 200 free relay along with teammates Nathan Piccolo and Alasdair Bell at a finish time of 1:21.35.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The team crushed competition on the second day of the Invitational, which was met with four different medals and moved Drexel from sixth place to fourth among the twelve standings. At a time of 48.41, Gkelis took home third in the 100 back. Kwasny placed second in the 100 flies with a time of 46.77 and Karnik, at a time of 53.57, took home third in the 100 breast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel &nbsp;ended on a high note on the third and last day of the Invitational. Karnik took second place in the 200 breasts at a time of 2:00.41. Teammates Alessio Gianni, Colton Wade, Smith, and Andrea Casini completed third place in the 400 free relay with a time of 2:59.92. Casini also was at the top of the podium with a gold medal for his 100 free swim-off time of 45.22.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The team represented the school well and made Drexel proud.

His tour of colleges and universities across the U.S. began in late October and concluded after five weeks spent visiting seven locations. The tour's mission was to raise awareness of young people's — especially college students' — mental health struggles and to encourage students to prioritize building valuable, healthy relationships.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Murthy's tour included a collaboration with MTV and the nonprofit Active Minds' Acknowledge, Support and Keep-In-Touch Campaign, which calls on young people to reach out to one another and focus on building a dedicated social support network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, events and activities at the Creese Center offered members of the Drexel community a place to gather and learn about the mission of the We Are Made To Connect Tour. At 6 p.m., the day's events culminated with a talk by Dr. Murthy alongside Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gaga's mother who co-founded the Born This Way Foundation with her daughter. The Born This Way Foundation supports youth mental health and aims to build a kinder and braver world through research, programs, and partnerships.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Murthy and Germanotta spoke about the isolation that often leads young students to struggle with forming and maintaining close personal relationships; they also discussed strategies that students can use to develop their connections with others. The final portion of their presentation involved Dr. Murthy issuing his 5-for-5 Connection Challenge — an element of his office's mission that challenges people to consciously build and strengthen their relationships each day for five days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following their talk, the Surgeon General and Germanotta engaged the audience in a Q&amp;A session, during which attendees asked the pair about how they discovered their passion for mental health activism.</p>\n<p>Dr. Murthy first decided to tackle mental health in students as an issue after reflecting on the challenges he faced growing up; as he said, \"the experiences we have that are difficult as kids sometimes stay with us as adults.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he first began as Surgeon General under President Barack Obama, he encountered accounts of mental health issues across the country and realized the majority silently struggled with their challenges. Finally, after witnessing the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic took on our society, he decided to prioritize mental well-being for this term, especially in youth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Young people have been particularly hard hit with rising rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide, partly as a result of COVID,\" Dr. Murthy explained. He emphasized that young people are our future; their prosperity is crucial for a bright tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During his visits to various colleges, Dr. Murthy observed a significant trend: students were more open regarding their experiences with loneliness when in collective settings. Initially, many felt a sense of shame attached to this feeling, but as people came together, a willingness to share emerged. Dr. Murthy noted that when just one person bravely expresses their feelings, it helps dissolve this shame.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Young people are really invested in wanting to address this issue because they're living it in real-time,\" he said. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He went on to discuss the influence of social media, which has been a point of concern on every campus he has visited. Its impact on students' mental health, which is almost always negative, poses a significant challenge with no clear resolution in sight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Murthy believes we must take urgent action to support youth facing the adverse effects of social media: \"it's stealing time away from in-person interaction, sleep, and other activities that we know young people need in their lives to be healthy.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there is one thing Dr. Murthy wants students to take out of his campaign, it is that if you are struggling with loneliness, there is a good chance you are not the only one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loneliness is a common struggle, and it's manageable through \"simple acts of connection… checking in on a friend, pausing to talk and say hello to a classmate,\" according to Dr. Murthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even if one's level of comfort with interaction and initiating social contact has diminished after COVID-19, Dr. Murthy wants students to know that's a muscle they can rebuild, and they can rebuild it with these small acts of connection. <br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

The goal is to ensure the campus is a safe space for everyone to coexist harmoniously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The university continues to see changes, one being the Banner system, an information system connected to applying for a job, student employment and student enrollment, updating in order to allow students to identify with multiple races.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Along with this upgrade, there has been a general increase in representation of marginalized groups according to reports. Within Black/African American undergraduates there was about a 2 percent rise, being that it was 9.7 percent in 2018 and 12 percent in 2022. Within graduates, there’s been about a 1.7 percent uptake, jumping from 13 to 14.7 percent within the four years. The number of Drexel’s full time Black faculty increased by about 1 percent while the benefit-eligible staff proportion has decreased by 1 percent.</p>\n<p>The ATRF have split up their research between two main points: culture and climate. According to the report, culture is defined as Drexel’s moral code in performance and their climate as how different groups are experiencing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the second year the Office for Institutional Equity and Inclusive Culture, after establishing their 64 commitments, had spread these goals across 43 different administrative and academic units to which 41 had responded. That is an increase from 32 units in 2022, showing improvements as the year went on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there will always be academic and administrative personnel who take on these commitments, there is no real effectiveness until the target audience (students, staff, faculty) have been satisfied. In a survey conducted in 2021 by the Higher Education Data Service Consortium, when asked on a scale of 1- 5 how content they were with the environment of the campus (1 being discontent and 5 being very content), there was an average of 3.79 from the general population. Within that, the mean of Black/African responses was 3.48.</p>\n<p>While there has been major headway, there is no success without some difficulties.</p>\n<p>“All of our commitments aren't gonna come to fruition, or haven't come to fruition,” said Kim Gholston, the vice president and chief diversity officer in the ARTF. “We're continuing to, to grow and develop and educate ourselves around the issues. . . we're trying some things, we're piloting a lot of things that we feel will move the needle on those commitments.”</p>\n<p>Many of the 41 units have created activities that invite students to different workshops, book clubs, resource sharing and large discussions.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/life-at-drexel/diversity-and-inclusion\">Office of Diversity and Inclusion</a> website showcases all events and corresponding dates..&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For staff, 33 units have stated that they have created outlets to include them, some of which include highlighting the nature of contracts with union members and having ties to leadership in the Real Estate and Facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two additional commitments were called for attention. One of which was emphasizing the necessity to have anti-racism and DEI teachings at the forefront of learning to explain what exemplary behavior was like and to maintain them. Twenty-nine of the units have responded with reports of their training workshops, event dialogues, and have mentioned that they are open to instruction from the university. The shining example this year was the Dornsife School of Public Health’s method of incorporating all leaders in an anti-racism action plan.</p>\n<p>The second point was creating a plan that closed the financial gap of minorities despite their advancement. Twenty-five units have responded to this, stating that they too have used this moment to report on the progress made, adding that they are “restating their commitment to revising the departments’ guidelines.”</p>\n<p>All in all, this past year has seen improvements as more &nbsp;units on campus are taking &nbsp;commitments seriously in order to ensure that the Drexel community remains harmonious with one another and remains a place of safety and comfort for all who walk its campus.</p>\n<p>“It's important to have those 64 commitments to recognize the need for us to remain on this journey to be an antiracist university,\" said Gholston. \"It has also served as a foundation for us to not only recognize the needs of our black and brown community, but to any group that is underrepresented in any area of the university.”</p>",

In their very first appearance in the Big 5 Classic, the team sat down for a quick press conference. “It is a great day for Philadelphia college basketball,” said Spiker.</p>\n<p>With both Drexel and Villanova finishing 0-2 in their pods, they would get to play each other in the fifth-place game. The Dragons went toe-toe with Villanova and never once trailed them throughout the game. The game came down to the final seven seconds where Drexel had a 57-55 lead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An inbounds pass found Villanova’s Justin Moore who drove into the paint being guarded by Drexel’s Lucas Monroe. His shot was viciously blocked by Drexel forward Amari Williams to help seal the victory over the Wildcats. This is Drexel's first ever win as part of the Big 5 and only their second win ever over Villanova, the first one dating back to 2006.</p>\n<p>“That was just 40 minutes into an awesome day and obviously very special for our basketball program,” said Spiker.</p>\n<p>Coach Spiker believes that the Big 5 was a great opportunity for the team, the athletic program and the university as a whole to get to compete in the tournament for the first time in a new format that removes the round-robin style of play to determine a champion for a new one. Two pods of three teams see each team playing twice and the results determining a Championship, third and fifth-place game to be played at the Wells Fargo Center.</p>\n<p>“To my guys on my left and right, I couldn’t be more proud of them,” said Spiker. He was mentioning Drexel’s Justin Moore and Amari Williams who both come from completely different basketball backgrounds. Moore, who grew up in Philadelphia and watching Big 5 basketball played high school basketball at Archbishop Wood before committing to Drexel.</p>\n<p>\"I know everybody on every team...It means a lot, &nbsp;you see these guys in the summer time and you know you grow up playing other kids from the city on those teams so like it just means a lot to go out there to compete against them,” said Moore.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is Amari Williams from Nottingham, England, who never felt the atmosphere that a stadium like the Wells Fargo Center could produce.</p>\n<p>“Basketball’s not really big in England,” Williams said. “We don’t have an atmosphere like this.”</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>It would be a lie to say that Drexel is a place where sports are at the forefront of a lot of people’s minds. Even for the athletes, Drexel is an attractive destination because of co-op, our academics and our location in the heart of Philadelphia. What you might not know, however, is that Drexel was once a school that rallied around its stellar athletic program. The time is now for both students and administration to embrace Drexel’s sports programs and propel our school forward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the sake of this argument, I want to focus most of this article on the basketball programs at Drexel because they are the largest revenue driving sport for Drexel. Just about a decade ago, Drexel Basketball was one of the most up-and-coming mid-major basketball programs in the country. They played in the CAA, a once competitive and feared conference, and they had star players who not only dominated at the college level, but also went on to have successful professional careers whether in the NBA or overseas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the 2011-2012, The DAC saw an average of 2,423 fans at each home game. They sold out The DAC five times that season, and when it wasn’t at capacity it was pretty close. The DAC Pack, the name for Drexel’s student section, became renowned and notorious for the energy and enthusiasm that they brought to each and every game. <a href=\"https://www.uwire.com/2013/10/25/rowdy-dac-pack-ready-to-start-another-bball-season/\"><u>In 2012, The DAC Pack was voted as the best student section in Philadelphia, and one of the top sixteen fan bases in the entire nation</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This enthusiasm for Drexel basketball waned over the years as the Men’s team faltered. However, since 2020, the Men’s team has been on an upwards trajectory, highlighted by the team’s historic return to the NCAA tournament. This year, the men entered into the season projected to be one of the best teams in the CAA. It is their best chance to return to March Madness since that 2021 team led by Cam Wynter and James Butler.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Something that I have heard far too often in my time here at Drexel is that the basketball teams “suck.” That is simply not true -- at all. Just in the past two years, the men <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoL58TDI5Tm/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"><u>beat</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoLwAh8Oyai/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"><u>a ranked College of Charleston</u></a> team on our home court, the women beat Penn State on our home court behind a historic <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmXRaVojShJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"><u>performance</u></a> by Drexel legend Keishana Washington, and now <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hd3tktyYoAY?feature=shared\"><u>the men toppled city rival and the 18th best team in the nation Villanova in our first ever Big 5 tournament</u></a>. If you were not one of the hundreds of students in attendance, you missed out on a dominant performance that should make every single Drexel student glow with pride and school spirit. Every single Drexel game is free for students to attend, there is literally no reason to not go to every game that you possibly can.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons that students can point to for their lack of interest in Drexel basketball. University administration’s historic apathy towards sports, lack of real rivalry games, under performance in big moments, disconnect between the students and the athletes and lackadaisical marketing of the teams by the school. All of these are fair gripes. However, the tide of Drexel basketball has been changing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Drexel was a slow adopter of the <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/sports/drexel-nil-is-still-subpar/\"><u>NIL rule changes</u></a> that have turned college basketball on its head, the University has finally announced the roll out of the <a href=\"https://dragonfirecollective.com/\"><u>Dragon Fire Collective</u></a>, Drexel’s NIL collective that will help try and recruit and retain the best players possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The school just over a season ago invested millions of dollars into renovations of The DAC. These investments come just after hiring a new, more qualified Athletic Director and bringing in professionals whose jobs it is to bring in both investments to the programs and energy to the fans. And it’s working.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last season, the DAC had its highest average attendance since 2014. This season, the DAC is averaging over 1,600 fans per game, and in Drexel’s first ever hosted Big 5 game against Temple, the DAC was completely sold out and the student section was so packed that students were actually turned away and unable to sit in the stands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, the school is beginning to recognize that investment in athletics is a valuable one, and it is now on the students now to invest our time and fandom into our Drexel Dragons. When students show up and get loud, The DAC is unlike any other environment to be at. It is deafening, the stands are shaking, you are literally just a few feet away from the players and you get to watch some thrilling basketball games. The time is right now for students to rally behind our basketball teams. And if you still think Drexel basketball sucks, just ask Villanova if they agree.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Drexel University offers several short-term study abroad courses called intensive courses abroad. These ICAs are typically taken during breaks between quarters and are followed by traditional classroom assignments like papers during the usual quarter time frame. One of the more unique opportunities offered by Drexel is the chance to go to Cuba. The United States has had turbulent relations with the island nation since the early 1960s, and travel to the country is still tightly controlled. Several students shared their impressions of the course with me in a series of discussions regarding Cuba and studying abroad.</p>\n<p>The course began with light reading and writing assignments in the summer prior to departure to prepare students for their eventual arrival in Cuba. Other logistical tasks were also completed including an application for a visa and the submission of any additional travel paperwork. Students met one time via Zoom before they arrived to talk about what the course would be like. Upon arrival, students were immediately put on a bus and began their journey to Cienfuegos, Cuba — the city where the majority of &nbsp;—coursework would be done during the 10 day trip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The course was led by four instructors, three of whom were Drexel professors. The fourth was Dairo Enrique Moreno, the founder of CIVITAS and our main guide throughout Cuba. Dairo was joined by two translators, Yadira Herrera Hernandez and Dayana Morffi Quintero. Several other memorable people made appearances throughout the trip, including students from Cuba's University of Cienfuegos and members of the local community who we would see on more than one occasion. Unlike traditional classroom experiences where students may sit next to the same person everyday and never exchange a word, the human element of the course brought students together in a novel way that helped foster feelings of community. Some of the best moments of the trip were as simple as running into familiar people on the street.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Morel, an undergraduate health sciences student, commented on these experiences by saying, “Spending time with the Cuban people and hearing from professors, medical professionals and locals taught me that it is a beautiful, persevering and valuable country that deserves more attention and respect from the rest of the world.”</p>\n<p>According to the students who participated, the course was informative but also challenging. When asked what challenges she faced, Morel mentioned her youth. The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, so the age range can be quite large from youngest to oldest. Morel, who was the youngest in the group, had to shift into a more mature and professional mindset. She mentioned how this was hard for her at first, but it helped her to experience a growing and reflective trip that she states she would not trade for anything.</p>\n<p>The trade embargo was the most commonly discussed topic. It impacts every aspect of life in Cuba. Lynelle Martin, an undergraduate student studying biomedical engineering, commented on the trade embargo stating, “I think it’s wrong because of the impact it has on food, clean water, medicine and other economic needs of the Cuban population. Even a large majority of the United Nations is for a resolution of the embargo, but the United States constantly vetoes it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The trade embargo was placed on Cuba by the Kennedy administration in the early 1960s as a way to punish Cuba for its ties to the USSR. Relations have never been great since then with each new American president supporting the embargo in some form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Riya Kumar, an undergraduate biology major, commented on the embargo stating, “Maybe historically it was necessary, but to have it in place all the way to now is not needed and hindering the progress of a country with such potential. It's easy to support the embargo when just thinking about Cuba as a whole country because it’s so depersonalizing. But when I saw the individual people it affected and how they had to live their lives a certain way just because of this embargo, it opened my eyes so much more.”</p>\n<p>Students formed into groups for their final assignment which was submitted halfway through the fall quarter after returning from Cuba.</p>\n<p>Emmy Shingara, a graduate student studying epidemiology, commented on how the experience impacted her views on Cuba by stating, “I realized that Cuba, along with other island nations, are becoming among the first to be greatly impacted by climate change. I left this trip reflecting on topics of environmental justice, and how communities who may not contribute to larger, global issues, may be the first to disproportionately feel the impacts, and consequently suffer from them.”</p>\n<p>The cost of the course is unfortunately not something that we can ignore. For students interested in ICAs, it is important to remember that there will be a substantial cost associated. That being said, the Cuba course included airfare and meals in the price which allowed for a smooth experience from start to finish. The level of organization was impressive from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, and the heavy emphasis on keeping time allowed us to experience as much of the country as possible.</p>\n<p>Morel, Shingara, Martin and Kumar agreed with each other regarding the costs of the course with Morel commenting, “I would rather pay to fulfill a credit in a country where I can experience new foods, cultures and places than pay high tuition in a university I will be attending for most of my degree. No amount of money should stop you from the experiences and lessons you will receive, as you will carry and cherish them for the rest of your life.” Martin made sure to mention the abundance of scholarships for those who qualify. In some cases, the cost of studying abroad may be less than you think.</p>\n<p>Every student who attended the trip enthusiastically said they would like to return to Cuba someday. When asked if students should study abroad, Shingara said, “Getting outside of what you know is not only challenging and uncomfortable, but it is rewarding and enriching. It is a privilege to do, but if you can study abroad, I greatly encourage you to. The memories last a lifetime!”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Morel, Martin and Kumar strongly agreed with her, with Morel adding, “If you can fulfill a credit while indulging yourself in a brand-new culture and way of life, you should most certainly capitalize and take it.”</p>\n<p>If you are financially able to do so it is absolutely worth the cost to travel abroad through an ICA. <a href=\"https://https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drexel.edu/global/student-programs/education-abroad/programs/intensive-courses-abroad/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1701734929094918&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Z7j2TsK1AlAjY3HTK-RZC\"><u>Drexel offers several ICAs each quarter for all majors</u></a>, and we encourage you to take one before you graduate. The experiences that students have through these opportunities are so unique when compared to traditional classroom courses that everyone should take at least one ICA before graduating.&nbsp;</p>",

Drexel would hold onto the lead for thirty-nine minutes, never letting Fairfield within arms reach of the lead.</p>\n<p>Drexel was able to control the game early on in the first half. Drexel’s aggressive defensive style caused problems for Fairfield as the Dragon’s full-court press proved effective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Fairfield was able to get into the paint they had to face Drexel’s defense head-on. Five minutes into the game, Fairfield’s Brycen Goodine learned the hard way when senior guard Yame Butler blocked his layup.</p>\n<p>The Dragon’s defense was heavily effective through their rebounding. Amari Williams and Lamar Oden Jr. had 13 and 10 rebounds respectively, holding Fairfield to only two second-chance points throughout the whole game. Drexel outrebounded Fairfield 42-26, with 9 offensive rebounds that led to 10 second-chance points for the Dragons.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s ability to switch the court and go on fast breaks also helped them control the game and extend their lead. An Oden Jr. defensive rebound quickly led to a fast break and a Garfield Turner layup that gave the Dragons an 18-4 lead.</p>\n<p>As the end of the first half neared, a quick inbounds pass found the hands of Jamie Bergens, who sprinted down the court and drained a buzzer-beating three-pointer to end the half. Drexel led 39-20 with all the momentum on their side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second half began with the same Drexel dominance in the first. A Williams layup and a Justin Moore jump shot extended the Dragon’s lead to 43-22.</p>\n<p>A Moore steal on Fairfield’s Jasper Floyd and a slam dunk had the entire crowd of 1,706 people on their feet as they continued to dominate the half.</p>\n<p>When the starting five was not on the court, Drexel’s bench was able to maintain control. The likes of Mate Okros, Bergens and Turner played an immense role in Drexel’s 29 bench points. Turner went 4-4 from the field and had nine points before leaving the game following a double-flagrant foul on Fairfield’s James Johns Jr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>House’s pull-up jump shot, midway through the second half gave the Dragons their largest lead of the night at 27 points. Dragons lead 53-26.</p>\n<p>Williams continued to wreak havoc on defense. His block on Fairfield guard Louis Bleechmore late in the second half was his second of the night. He scored another layup before leaving the game to a roar of cheers from the Drexel crowd. Williams finished the game with a 13 point 13 rebound double-double along with 3 assists, 2 blocks, and a steal.</p>\n<p>“I think my team did a good job just trying to find me in the post, it was not always open but just to get the look and I think it's just crashing the boards too I feel like as a team we all crash the boards really and that’s why we get a lot of rebound together,” said Williams.</p>\n<p>Triple zeros hit as the Dragons won 65-47. They go 2-2 on the season that’s still very early on with a lot of basketball left to be played. Drexel would go on to take down Queens (N.C.) in the final of the Market Street Challenge two days later.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>“How many of you have difficulty with public speaking?”</p>\n<p>This was the question Professor Rosemary Rys asked on the first day of my COM 230 Techniques of Speaking class. Although I never considered myself as being an introvert, I had always faced anxiety when speaking in front of a crowd, whether it was large or small, so my answer was quite simple: I do<i>.</i> Yet, I found myself with my hands unraised because I did not want the professor to call on me. Even though it is not overwhelming, the fear of being put in the spotlight was strong enough to make me avoid answering a question that was quite relevant to me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the time came for me to deliver my first speech, I remember that fear being much stronger. I had to pick out a famous speech of my choice — a simple enough task — and then had to stand in front of the classroom to read it. I was nervous to give a speech in front of total strangers, who would undoubtedly have their eyes on me. As I walked up, my heart rate increased, my cheeks became hot, and even my hands were a little shaky.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eventually, I learned to conquer this fear. As the weeks flew by, I gave countless speeches —nearly one every week — and each was a little more creative and personal than the previous one as I became more familiar with my classmates. My heart was no longer racing, my fingers were steady and my voice was clear. I gradually lowered my use of filler words until my speeches were free of them, and I have undoubtedly come out as a more confident speaker than before taking COM 230.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that my journey was a lone effort. With each step, I had the guidance of Professor Rys, an assistant teaching professor in the Department of Communication, who has 32 years of teaching experience under her belt. Rys received her bachelor’s in marketing management from the Wharton Business School and eventually went on to receive her master’s in public relations from Rowan University. To her, public relations is another form of communication; it involves promoting companies, writing news releases, organizing events and much more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the diverse pool of eleven communication courses Rys teaches, COM 230 is a workshop course with consistent practice talks, impromptu speeches and formal speeches that provide a strong foundation for students to build on their public speaking skills. As students let their creativity loose with these speeches, professors help them with consistent feedback to hone their speaking skills. This is what the course helped me accomplish, and it holds the potential to do the same for students willing to embrace it.</p>\n<p>Something key for a course as concentrated on public speaking as COM 230 is the students being comfortable with one another. When asked about her thoughts on this, Rys replied, “Most people who don’t do public speaking are afraid of it, or at least they think they are. If I get them comfortable with each other, they will be comfortable speaking in front of each other.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Her main strategy is using public speaking games such as two truths and a lie and story starters, which allow students to become familiar with each other. Naturally, this also increases their confidence levels, encouraging them to blossom during their speeches, a similar experience to mine. Soon enough, the classroom becomes filled with over twenty “cheerleaders” when students get up to give their speeches.</p>\n<p>It is fair to say that the benefits that come with exposing yourself to this environment and becoming a confident speaker far outweigh any hesitancy students may have initially. Not only do they leave as articulate speakers, but their confidence also carries over to other settings: “If you go to a biology class, and you have to present, you’re confident because those people from this class are still in your head,” claims Rys. This is something I can attest to; while I may have been nervous about giving a speech ten weeks ago, this is no longer the case after my exposure to this course. My presentations are much smoother now, devoid of the “um’s” and “ah’s” that used to obscure my words.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course, students can expect to receive constructive criticism from their professor to fine-tune their speeches. The flaws are usually easy fixes; students may speak too fast and rush their words, or maybe they don’t use enough hand gestures to make the audience feel like they’re interacting. Rys, in particular, tackles these by encouraging students to slow down, pace themselves, walk slowly while speaking and, ultimately, by giving personalized written feedback using her trusty rubric, which has helped me overcome my own shortcomings. Though each professor may bring a different course format and method of feedback to the table, the course objectives remain firm and students will undoubtedly walk out as better speakers.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the course’s benefits extend beyond a classroom setting as having proper communication skills is essential in the real world. According to Rys, who has a very diversified career experience, “CEOs often look for people who are good speakers and good writers because they’re the ones who are &nbsp;going to get that grant written to bring more funding for the company…or do a speech that’s so moving that everybody wants to sign up for their program.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No matter what employers are looking for, great speakers are sought because effective communication is a skill demanded across all professions. Employers will notice its presence on resumes and during interviews, and this can give an edge to students who have taken the course.</p>\n<p>To students who are unsure about taking COM 230 at Drexel, Rys says, “Just do it. It’ll be worth your time.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I couldn’t agree more. Enrolling in COM 230 can allow students to expose themselves to an environment filled with challenge and resilience, where they can adapt and grow. Rys also encourages students to consider joining Drexel Speaks, a student organization devoted to improving public speaking skills, where she serves as the Faculty Advisor and extends her guidance beyond the course curriculum. It goes without saying that the relevance of well-polished speaking skills doesn't come with predefined moments; they are essential in countless aspects of life.&nbsp;</p>",

                "Concert Review"
            ],
            "body_html": "<p>On Tuesday Nov 21, L.A.-based artists <a href=\"https://www.earlsweatshirt.com/\"><u>Earl Sweatshirt</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alanthechemist/?hl=en\"><u>The Alchemist</u></a> took the stage at the Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia for the eighth stop of their Voir Dire Tour. With only 11 stops spanning the month of Nov, the duo performed to promote their new collab album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-XzOCgq5A0&amp;list=PLPRWtKgY2MOuiRJNXKrqybT69vOykdK2w\"><u>“Voir Dire</u></a>.” Accompanying them on their tour are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blackxnoise/\"><u>Black Noi$e</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mikelikesrap/?hl=en\"><u>MIKE</u></a> in select cities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While doors were slated to open at seven, it wasn’t until 7:30 p.m. that patrons were allowed into the venue in groups, and after more waiting. With so many artists scheduled to perform and such a delay in the entry process, the concert lasted significantly longer than expected. The audience was pleasantly surprised when Black &nbsp;Noi$e was only 30 minutes late to his anticipated 8 p.m. start time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With no introduction, Black Noi$e began his DJ set with house music before transitioning into remixes of songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6eXM7s8Vl5WcECcRHc2qQ\"><u>Kanye West’s</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAz3rnLGthg\"><u>“Flashing Lights”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pinkpantheress/?hl=en\"><u>PinkPantheress</u></a>’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tPTrgGptU0\"><u>“Break It Off”</u></a>. His set was short, and he brought up another unnamed DJ to assist him before turning it over to MIKE at around 8:50 p.m. Though the show started late, there was no wait time between performers and they often joined one another on stage before beginning their own sets. MIKE was extremely high energy, thanking the crowd repeatedly for their attendance, encouraging audience participation, giving props to the technical crew, security and most importantly, his mother. However, MIKE’s set seemed to run almost as long as Earl Sweatshirt’s and longer than the Alchemist’s. On top of this, because of how little time they gave Black Noi$e and the already later start time, it seemed as though MIKE would’ve benefitted from a shorter set.</p>\n<p>At 9:40 p.m., the Alchemist took over the DJ booth and began playing a combination of his own produced music, unreleased songs and remixes of other artists. However, there was very little going on visually and other artists were not featured that much. Through no fault of his own, it is very difficult to create a captivating live performance with no performance factor involved. To his credit, the Alchemist was very high energy, encouraging the crowd to dance and moving with his own music.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seemed as though Earl Sweatshirt was supposed to join the Alchemist once he had got on but had not. The Alchemist made comments throughout his set like “Where is he” and “We’re trying to find him” until he finally joined at around 10 .p.m. Upon his arrival, Earl joked, “Philly, I was fighting for my life trying to get here.” Luckily, he made up for his postponement with an extensive setlist, lively performance, and crowd interaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether you were a fan of his older music or came solely for the new album, there was something for everyone. Earl performed songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ps4DJND0vw\"><u>“Vin Skully”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnRGLKhFcIk\"><u>“Sirius Blac”</u></a> off of “Voir Dire”, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4caTCHR4xo\"><u>“The Mint”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twT1zz5GMfU\"><u>“Shattered Dreams”</u></a> off of his most critically acclaimed album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrcY1UsxtIk\"><u>“Some Rap Songs”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lduBHDjIarY\"><u>“2010”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCcXId9aM3s\"><u>“Vision”</u></a> from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRA4zbSR8V4&amp;list=PLnsf486e2mwTCCqey9YwxaqZz57uqK5no\"><u>“SICK!”</u></a>. Along with some of his more popular songs, he covered songs like <a href=\"https://tour.playboicarti.com/\"><u>Playboi Carti’s</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8gMVwaamEI\"><u>“JumpOutTheHouse”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meekmill/?hl=en\"><u>Meek Mill’s</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8gfqs1-NuE\"><u>“Dreams and Nightmares”</u></a>. Earl made sure to use the entire stage, crack jokes with the crowd between songs and deliver a live experience enjoyable for new and old fans alike.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the show had some issues, each performer brought a unique and memorable experience to the stage that was overall very enjoyable. Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE were both highlights of the night, but every set complimented one another and added something different to the show. Make sure to check out Black Noi$e, MIKE and “Voir Dire” on all streaming platforms.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Jimmy Donaldson — better known as Mr. Beast — held up a Drexel University DragonCard to his nearly 20 million followers on the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy on Nov. 12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"This card alone,\" Mr. Beast states, \"has saved over three million people from malnutrition.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The student ID belonged to Evan Ehlers, Drexel alumnus and founder of the charitable organization Sharing Excess.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In collaboration with Sharing Excess, Beast Philanthropy has committed to donating 30 million dollars in food. Dedicated to preventing food waste and feeding the hungry, but in need of financial support, Ehlers' team at Sharing Excess reached out to Mr. Beast with a record-breaking idea: creating the world's largest food distribution. From there, a partnership was launched.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through their existing warehouse, Sharing Excess has rescued over 14 million pounds of food, sorting through produce daily. In their newest endeavor with Beast Philanthropy, they're taking on Hunts Point Produce Market in New York City, the largest in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their first distribution in NYC was their biggest one yet; as Ehlers emphasizes in the video, they finally have \"enough food to actually make a huge dent in the problem.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, Beast Philanthropy donates over two million meals a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a graduate of Drexel's Close School of Entrepreneurship, Ehlers shared valuable insights into his journey and the lessons he learned along the way. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Ehlers started Sharing Excess as a student, it was just a way to use the excess meal swipes in his account; he found himself wanting to offer the food to anyone who needed it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He took some of the tips he learned from his major — \"give it a name, take some videos… try to inspire other students to do the same thing.\" From there, it snowballed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he began hitting bureaucratic walls regarding the university allowing meal swipe donations, Ehlers started reaching out to his friends who were cashiers at grocery stores and cafes, such as Trader Joe's and Saxby's. He and a group of students started picking up food that was perfect quality but being thrown away and gave it out to community organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ehlers would utilize his grandma's car daily between classes: \"I would Tetris the boxes in the back, and I always had to leave a little room at the top so I could see out the windshield. It was probably a little dangerous.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their work expanded through word of mouth, and they began organizing fundraisers and making local partnerships. When the pandemic hit, there was a great increase in food insecurity; jobs were lost, and food was simultaneously wasted as businesses closed. Throughout the pandemic, Sharing Excess became the backbone of the food distribution scene in Philadelphia, known for being incredibly reactive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Every time we'd get that bat signal, there's food around, we'd go,\" Ehlers explained.</p>\n<p>Now, the organization has grown to thirty-five employees and continues to distribute food in 26 states. They have partnered with many foundations and organizations, including Mr. Beast's, to make this happen; at this moment, every dollar donated to Sharing Excess lets them donate 20 pounds of food, and they're raising about 2.7 million dollars a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ehler was recently featured in Forbes' 2023 list of 30 Under 30, which gave the organization national exposure. The video on Beast Philanthropy's YouTube channel has garnered 13 million views in three weeks, which resulted in even more exposure; people have reached out to Ehler from 47 different cities across 17 countries, looking to implement some form of Sharing Excess. Now, he faces the exciting challenge of scaling the organization to an international level. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked about how current students at Drexel could work to impact their community as he did, Ehlers' advice was simple: \"If you've identified a problem, don't let it sit in the back of your mind. Get up and try to do something about it today.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During its earliest stages, Ehlers shared that he struggled to believe an organization like Sharing Excess could change the world, even at a smaller level. However, he realized that change starts with small actions, and every effort contributes to a larger impact over time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also emphasized the value of leveraging Drexel's resources. After he presented his idea for Sharing Excess, the Close School provided Ehlers with six months of co-op, funding and office space on the fourth floor of Pearlstein Learning Center to develop it further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"It's kind of like the co-op that never ended,\" he remarked, \"because I'm still doing it to this day.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ehlers' parting words suggested that current Drexel students join and support our chapter of Sharing Excess, which continues to make a tangible difference locally by addressing food insecurity and waste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Humza Imam, current junior and president of Sharing Excess at Drexel, shares some of their current initiatives: \"We have pop-ups at the Dragon Statue and on Lancaster Walk every other Friday… we're working with the overarching organization now to do pop-ups at the Dornsife Center to engage with the local community outside of campus.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Volunteering together is a great way to make friends while helping your community,\" Imam added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ehlers' entrepreneurial journey, from gathering extra meal swipes as a Drexel student to having Sharing Excess's story heard by millions, underscores the transformative nature of seemingly small initiatives. The partnership with Mr. Beast is only the beginning for this organization, and the future holds limitless opportunities for growth, making this the perfect time for current students to get involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"To see that there are students to this day collecting those donated meal swipes… it's just such an awesome feeling to know that something you started can have a legacy,\" &nbsp;Ehler stated.&nbsp;</p>",

The event included introductions and trivia games to familiarize the students and professors with each other and the program.</p>\n<p>This program is a new initiative introduced by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences David S. Brown. Before Brown came to Drexel University over a year ago, he was the department chair of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado, where they had a program named Studio, which got students involved in research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After coming to Drexel, Brown wanted to create a similar program and get “research into the hands of undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>Students who are accepted into the Research Support Fund program are paired with faculty members to assist them with ongoing research projects. This program is all about active learning and the chance for students to experience a more hands-on type of learning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The position lasts six-months, with a commitment of three to five hours a week, in which the students will work on the project and earn $1500.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As mentioned by Brown, this program is not only a chance for students to do work for faculty, but for them to “get out there and learn the basis of how you do research.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Brown, this kind of research is how “you get students excited and passionate about what they’re doing.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the help of the Associate Dean Scott Warnock, Professor Ashley Dickinson, and Professor Christina Love, this program was brought to life at Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the invaluable experience of working with faculty members in projects related to their field of interest, this program will also &nbsp;encourage students to interact with each other.</p>\n<p>Brown describes the interconnected program as an “ecosystem.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The program will also create opportunities to further help students by holding workshops and bringing people in to talk to students about their fields.</p>\n<p>The program is very diverse in terms of fields of study as well as levels of undergraduate students. The entire student body of the College of Arts and Sciences, freshmen through seniors, are eligible to participate in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This diversity is reflected in the eleven faculty projects, which are spread out among what Warnock describes as a “really nice range,” not only of disciplines but also of “different kinds of research activities.”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, they were very deliberate in creating a diverse program by having two of the main professors involved in creating the program representing both the natural sciences, with Love, and the social sciences with Dickinson.</p>\n<p>The program is planned to have two cohorts each year, with applications for the second cohort of this year to open at the end of the winter term. The distant future for the program is also looking hopeful as there is a lot of interest for the program among students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project proved to be successful beyond imagining. According to Warnock, they had eleven faculty proposals to be matched with students and they hoped they would be able to make it to twenty student applications. Instead they received 89. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both Brown and Warnock expressed their desire to expand the program so that more students and faculty could be part of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brown said that he is now working on getting people to help provide additional resources so that they can “bring the other 70 students into the fold, which is something I’m excited about.”&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>At the Team Impact’s Philadelphia gala, one theme was prominent: community. Athletes, coaches, community members, children who have been part of the program and executives at team IMPACT came together to celebrate the commitment of Big 5 basketball schools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Team Impact is a non-profit founded in 2011 by a group of former college students in Boston, that has now expanded to many major cities and universities. Their mission focuses on matching children with disabilities or serious illnesses with collegiate sports teams to create bonds the children and athletes will never forget.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The organization was inspired by Co-Founder Jay Calnan’s brother Chris, who has a condition that has prevented him from participating in sports, and was given the opportunity to be a bat boy for a Boston Red Sox minor league affiliate. This experience inspired Calnan and seven of his college friends to reconnect and establish Team Impact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The event opened with a “tailgate,” which saw all people present walking around the venue, socializing and mingling, as the hall was filled with community members wearing college apparel for their respective Big 5 school. Following the tailgate, the attendees filed into a large hall to hear speakers from Team IMPACT.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The presentation was opened by IMPACT Co-CEO Brad Korman who introduced the IMPACT Philly goals and successes with possible donors and community members, showing emotional videos demonstrating the good the organization has already done in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following Korman’s introduction, sixteen-year-old Jacob Orlick took the stage to talk about his battle with cancer and being a part of the University of Pennsylvania’s Men’s Basketball Team. Throughout his time on stage, Jacob showed his speaking chops presenting his great humor with an uplifting story of beating cancer, and how creating bonds with the UPenn basketball players and coach changed both his and the athletes mindsets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ever since his match with the team has ended, Jacob has found his passion in broadcasting, saying “It’s my passion and always has been,” while giving thanks to the UPenn team for helping him realize he could still be a part of athletics as he’s always desired. Jacob’s emotional yet hilarious speech was a tearjerker for many, especially with his line, “I’m Jacob. I’m just me.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following Jacob’s presentation, all six Big 5 schools were honored and acknowledged for the work they do before Josh Walker, Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic region, closed out the presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I spoke with Josh prior to the event, he could not be happier with the work Big 5 schools, including Drexel had already done to implement and strengthen Team IMPACT’s mission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Tonight’s event is a celebration of the work that the schools in Philadelphia have been doing for kids in local children’s hospitals,” Walker said. “[Philadelphia] is a community of support and through college athletics, we’re making matches that change these kids' lives.”</p>",

            "body_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/\"><u>Billboard’s Year End charts</u></a> were shared following their <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/h/bbmaswatch/\"><u>Billboard Music Awards</u></a> show on Nov. 19, which includes their list of the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/#\"><u>100 most successful hits</u></a> of the past year. Pop music fans can now look back at the biggest songs on the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/\"><u>Hot 100 singles chart</u></a> throughout 2023 and decide which ones to save, and which to block out for the rest of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the tracking year for the charts usually runs into November, this year’s tracking was cut short on the week of Oct. 21, making it <a href=\"https://pulsemusic.proboards.com/post/8510365/thread\"><u>only a 49-week tracking year</u></a> (this notably bumps the “<a href=\"https://taylor.lnk.to/1989taylorsversion\"><u>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</u></a>” chart impact to next year). It could be assumed that this was for the sake of the Billboard Music Awards, since the announcement of this change was made <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/2023-billboard-music-awards-nominees-list-1235454697/\"><u>in an article</u></a> by Billboard detailing the award show nominees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the 2023 year-end Hot 100 is pretty unexciting. It lacks many standouts in both the great and the horrible songs, which made determining this list a bit harder. Overall, it leans more towards the bad than the good for me, possibly due to the heavy saturation of pop country, a genre I find very repetitive and ignorable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Top 5 best hits of 2023:</b></p>\n<p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr7oYjnt3bM\"><u>“Fast Car” - Luke Combs</u></a> (#8 on the list) We can only hope that the younger generations become aware of the legacy that this song had before <a href=\"https://www.lukecombs.com/\"><u>Combs</u></a> covered it. In a year where country’s dominance was tainted by backwards politics (see Morgan Wallen and Jason Aldean’s <a href=\"https://xpn.org/2023/08/31/country-music-billboard/\"><u>success</u></a>), it was great to see such a classic, relatable song about the working class struggle from a genuine woman like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIOAlaACuv4\"><u>Tracy Chapman</u></a> get revived, even if it was through the voice of another artist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br/>\n4. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NNd_ufPG3x4?feature=shared\"><u>“Nobody Gets Me” - SZA</u></a> (#77 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MSRcC626prw?feature=shared\"><u>Kill Bill</u></a>,” “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LDY_XyxBu8A?feature=shared\"><u>Snooze</u></a>” and “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hdFDrjfW548?feature=shared\"><u>Shirt</u></a>” all qualifying for this list, the ballad “Nobody Gets Me” stands out for its potent chorus melodies and harmonies. The song’s overall sound is reminiscent of something <a href=\"https://kellyclarkson.com/chemistrydeluxe/\"><u>Kelly Clarkson</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.leonalewismusic.com/\"><u>Leona Lewis</u></a> would have sung in the 2000s (inevitably <a href=\"https://genius.com/artists/Ryan-tedder\"><u>written by Ryan Tedder</u></a>), except none of them would have said anything from <a href=\"https://www.szasos.com/\"><u>SZA</u></a>’s first verse on record. This spot goes more to SZA’s breakthrough year than any of her songs specifically; it is shocking how quickly a 23-track album became overplayed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br/>\n3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/q4GJVOMjCC4?feature=shared\"><u>“Sure Thing” - Miguel</u></a> (#24 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I remember seeing this song on the iTunes Store charts when I was a child… despite including two songs that were originally released more than a decade ago on this list, I do in fact like new music a lot. This 2010 single admittedly lacks in the verse lyrics, where <a href=\"https://www.officialmiguel.com/\"><u>Miguel</u></a> reuses the same metaphor setup over and over. However, the irresistibly smooth instrumental and chorus are why this song is back in the first place. Also, it has now been six years since his last album “<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nqtoFw5VU0XGk1RosWVCfqogewg2bBnHA&amp;feature=shared\"><u>War and Leisure</u></a>,” hopefully the next project is in the works.</p>\n<p><br/>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhbixyxgsiU\"><u>“Just Wanna Rock” - Lil Uzi Vert</u></a> (#28 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Admittedly, this song is very overplayed at this point. It does not help that it is barely two minutes long either. However the raw energy and spacey atmosphere of this song are pure Uzi, who has always claimed to be from another planet. The “<a href=\"https://djmag.com/features/endless-evolution-jersey-club\"><u>Jersey club</u></a>” drumbeat this song uses has existed long before this song, but since when has it appeared within the top 30 on a Billboard Hot 100 year-end list? “Just Wanna Rock” is now up there with Uzi’s defining songs, and it sounds like nothing they have made before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4\"><u>“Boy’s A Liar, Pt. 2” - PinkPantheress and Ice Spice</u></a> (#20 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there is a hit song that should define 2023, it is this. Similar to “Just Wanna Rock,” “Boy’s A Liar, Pt. 2” fuses electronic music, hip-hop and pop while also managing to sustain an underlying melancholy feeling that is exposed perfectly at the end of Ice Spice’s verse as the instrumental breaks down. With the help of producer <a href=\"https://genius.com/artists/Mura-masa\"><u>Mura Masa</u></a>, this song feels futuristic yet a bit nostalgic at the same time, a trait that PinkPantheress has been effortlessly good at achieving (while <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nDFJQ8G2RNYuZriujUlrGlOWrfBW8ASdI&amp;feature=shared\"><u>Dua Lipa attempted</u></a> and only landed one side of it). Hopefully these artists will continue evolving their sounds and spawning more girly hits in the coming years.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>Top 3 worst hits of 2023:</b></p>\n<p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLzUmfLckEw\"><u>“Thank God” - Kane and Katelyn Brown</u></a> (#23 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why does this give me “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2_evn2rg-80?feature=shared\"><u>JERIKA</u></a>” flashbacks? “Thank God” is the most offensively inoffensive, conveyor-belt, factory made song of the year. It is an instant skip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br/>\n2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b1_RKu-ESCY?feature=shared\"><u>“Try That in a Small Town” - Jason Aldean</u></a> (#66 on the list)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, “Try That in a Small Town” may be the biggest reason why pop country was tainted with underlying racism this year, while artists like <a href=\"https://www.zachbryan.com/\"><u>Zach Bryan</u></a> and <a href=\"https://noahkahan.com/#/\"><u>Noah Kahan</u></a> are being pushed, frantically trying to save face for their genre. Threatening violence with violence does not make one side correct, and filming a music video in front of a courthouse with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-video-edited-blm\"><u>well-known racist history</u></a> will obviously strengthen a message.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br/>\n1. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gPCCYMeXin0?feature=shared\"><u>“Made You Look” - Meghan Trainor</u></a> (#53 on the list) There was a brief moment in late 2022 when humanity was faced with the reality of a <a href=\"https://www.meghan-trainor.com/\"><u>Meghan Trainor</u></a> mainstream comeback. Luckily, the crisis was swiftly averted before the even worse “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9coyY-SPIXU?feature=shared\"><u>Mother</u></a>” could touch the Hot 100, and the public snapped back to their senses. This song tapped into the icky, horn-embellished retro pop that plagued Trainor’s <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1JRUJcgNLVvDh9CGv9i-B_s1KrKyfgl&amp;feature=shared\"><u>breakthrough hits</u></a> in 2015, recreating that horrible style that was apparently not missed at all, given no one has tried to recreate it since. Also, the brand name-drops on the chorus are the worst hook of the year.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Dean Paula Marantz Cohen will be stepping down as dean of Drexel University’s Pennoni Honors College at the end of the academic year, after ten years in the role. The decision was announced Oct. 26, in a letter from President John Fry and Provost Paul E. Jensen.</p>\n<p>Cohen says she is stepping down to focus on other pursuits. She will be taking a sabbatical to write a book based on a talk she presented on the current state of universities. She also plans to spend more time with family, particularly after the recent birth of her granddaughter. After her leave, she will return to teaching at Drexel as a Distinguished Professor of English.</p>\n<p>Cohen is excited to see someone else step into the role and to watch the college continue to evolve.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a dean for ten years; I feel I’ve accomplished more or less what I wanted to, and so I’ll step back into the faculty,” Cohen added.</p>\n<p>Still, she describes the change as bittersweet. The college has a staff of sixteen people, and honors students represent about ten percent of the student body. Also, professors from across the university teach honors courses. Cohen feels saddened to leave behind the Pennoni community.</p>\n<p>Cohen graduated from Yale University with bachelor’s degrees in English and French. Afterwards, she spent a year teaching English to high school students in France as part of a Fulbright Scholarship. Back in the states, she received a PhD in English Literature from Columbia University. In New York City, she held a few teaching jobs before starting at Drexel.</p>\n<p>As a professor, Cohen specializes in 19th-century British literature, her personal favorite period. She has taught a variety of English classes, as well as courses in film. A literature lover at heart, she keeps a framed portrait of Jane Austen next to her desk computer.</p>\n<p>She is the author of five nonfiction books and five novels. Her works reflect her academic interests, as seen in her debut novel \"Jane Austen in Boca<i>,\"</i> which reimagines \"Pride and Prejudice\" as the story of a group of retirees trying to find love again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I consider myself a writer just as much as a dean or a professor,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Cohen is only the third dean in her title. Cohen says she has followed in the footsteps of her predecessors, while continuing to push the college into the future. Most notably, during her tenure she oversaw the renovation of Calhoun Hall into Bentley Hall. The renovation expanded the building to include classrooms, offices, and meeting spaces for Pennoni Honors College, which had previously been scattered across campus.</p>\n<p>Cohen also initiated several programs, including a weekly community Shakespeare Read-Aloud and the Center for Civil Discourse, which creates a platform for students to engage in conversation about difficult topics. Cohen believes in the benefits of the honors college and the seminar style coursework it offers.</p>\n<p>“I have a great affection for this university and especially for my students,” Cohen said.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Thomas R. Kline School of Law at Drexel University launched their undergraduate law program in 2022, making it one of six law schools in the United States offering a bachelor's of arts in law.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2006, the Kline School of Law provides students with a thorough understanding of the law through application-based education. Kline administered an undergraduate law minor in 2021 and a year later took this program one step further and implemented the undergraduate law major, allowing students to examine the world through the lens of the American legal system through interactive classes, focused co-ops, and guidance from faculty at the earlier stages in their education.</p>\n<p>“The undergraduate law program at Kline aims to provide students with a rigorous, intellectually challenging introduction to the field of law,” said Rose Corrigan, PhD, associate dean for undergraduate education at the Kline School of Law. “We encourage students to take an interdisciplinary approach to studying law and to think about legal careers in addition to being an attorney.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the program, students must complete either another major or a minor in a secondary field. This is part of building a strong educational foundation, so students do not view law in isolation, according to Corrigan. There is no restriction on this second field of study, and students are encouraged to take advantage of the wide variety of subjects that Drexel has to offer.</p>\n<p>The undergraduate law curriculum incorporates nine core courses summing to 32 credits and 28 elective credits, up to 16 of which may be taken outside of the law major. The core courses are designed to be engaging and interactive for students, an example being LAW 102: Law Lab, where students take a series of field trips around Philadelphia to examine law access and implementation in different settings through hands-on activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One section of the course curriculum is the “Culture and Society” requirement, consisting of 16 credits. Students are encouraged to gain awareness of their place in the world, whether that be globally or focused within the United States. This requirement is also flexible and can be satisfied through language and other cultural courses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’ve always loved French. I’ve taken it for almost eight years now, and so it is really important to me that I was able to continue it here at Drexel without having to major in it,” said Taniyah Spencer, a fourth-year law student with a minor in French. “My major has to do with what I want to pursue in my work life, and my minor is something that is very important to me in my personal life. I think it’s really enjoyable that Drexel has allowed me to combine those two experiences.”</p>\n<p>The intersection between law and the chosen second field of study extends past just fulfilling the degree requirement and can be explored further with co-ops. Kline is actively utilizing their alumni network to create more co-op opportunities for undergraduates to gain experience in a variety of legal careers. Students are encouraged to learn about all of the career opportunities that are available, especially since there are students in the program that aim to attend law school and pursue law-adjacent careers following their undergraduate tenure at Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We have a lot more co-ops with law firms opening up, but there are also some people not interested in going to law school,” said Lois Cho, a fifth-year former nursing major who switched into the undergraduate law program after her third year. “Being in nursing gave me a lot of skills that I didn’t have prior to college, like patient interaction and community engagement. I learned about healthcare policy and HIPPA, which made me more interested in the law side of things. This helped a lot during my most recent co-op at a civil rights firm where I was working with interpreting medical records, so I got to use my experience there.”</p>\n<p>Kline is continuing to add onto their undergraduate program to better shape the educational lens through which students look at law. According to Corrigan, Kline is piloting an opportunity this upcoming winter quarter where six undergraduates will take a higher-level course alongside postgraduate students. The goal is to gain an understanding of how undergraduates perform at the advanced level and to see if there is an opportunity down the road to create an accelerated degree, something that Drexel is known for implementing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When introducing a complex topic such as the American legal system to students, it is crucial to understand the proper methods to convey information and to focus on the needs of the group on the receiving end. Creating and fostering a learning community within the program has been extremely important for student success.</p>\n<p>“I think the connection that a lot of the UG Law students have with the professors is really important. Our professors are probably our most beneficial resource, whether it be for helping us better understand material, finding co-ops or helping us exhaust options as to what path in a legal career would be most attainable and suitable for each of our needs,” Spencer said.</p>\n<p>Faculty, administration and staff at Kline work closely with their students, especially at the undergraduate level. Student accounts and input are valued and encouraged to improve the program and create opportunities that further enhance the undergraduate learning experience and foster a passion for the law.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve really focused on is hiring faculty who I think are focused on figuring out how to teach a difficult subject at a level where undergraduates can succeed,” Corrigan said. “[Learning law] can feel like learning a foreign language because it has a specialized vocabulary, and I think one way to get around that is with faculty who are dedicated to teaching at a high level but getting through to undergraduate students. Kline as a law school has always had a student-focused approach and we have been trying to bring that to the undergraduate level as well.”</p>\n<p>For more information about the Thomas R.

As they enroll in Drexel for a variety of reasons besides wanting to complete their degrees here, transfer students must adjust the way they are learning, studying and balancing time to meet others within the quarter-system.</p>\n<p>Students often transfer to Drexel wanting to change their learning environment because the university they started at was not the best for their needs.</p>\n<p>Kimberly Chen, a senior health sciences and psychology major who transferred from Jefferson University in the fall of 2021, said, “The reason why it didn’t sit well for me is personally... because I’m used to going to schools that have bigger populations of students, more diversity and more extra-curricular activities because even in high school I was involved in a lot of organizations, so I thought, ‘It was time to transfer’ because I didn’t really fit in.”</p>\n<p>Others who already earned a degree or certification wanted to further their higher education experiences and saw that Drexel had the resources to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I did graduate with my associates [and] I love CCP, I’m a huge advocate for it, and I think it helped bridge my love of learning again,” says Erica Alston, a third-year environmental engineering major who transferred from Community College of Philadelphia in the fall of 2023. “Here it’s bigger, and there’s more people with the same interests as me [as well as] more clubs, which is the biggest difference.”</p>\n<p>Some also want a school that better fits their financial needs, depending on their family background.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you are a minority and you are low-income, Drexel is going to give you a bunch of money,” said Ani Chonta, a fourth-year mathematics and economics major who transferred from multiple colleges in the fall of 2021, her last transferred credit being from Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“People say Drexel is so expensive. Yeah, it is, it’s expensive for those who don’t come from a low economic background,” Chonta said.</p>\n<p>Getting into Drexel is the same as for any other first-time undergraduate student: All they need to do is submit an essay and a transcript.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, the transition from a semester system to Drexel's quarter system is more complicated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As an entirely different form of learning, Alston adds, “It’s definitely not more material-wise, but to cram everything within ten weeks makes it more rigorous.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Given the campus size, students often need help adjusting from small to large classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Here, because it’s so big, you could get easily lost,” Chonda adds. “The professor doesn’t always have a connection with the students because they just have a lot of students and other classes too.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the hardships of getting in and adjusting to Drexel as a transfer student, the process is gratifying when transfer students begin to embrace Drexel’s welcoming environment, unique academic system and supportive programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you know that Drexel’s community is one you want to be a part of, then go for it; don’t be afraid because everyone here is really accepting, and you get to meet all types of people from different backgrounds, but if you’re very hesitant because you don’t know what you are doing, I would take a step back and reevaluate what your pros and cons and what you prefer as a student,\" said Chen.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Welcome to the thrilling saga of the \"Midterm Chronicles\" at Drexel University, where the aroma of coffee competes with the stench of impending deadlines, and where students embark on a fantastical journey through the Land of Academic Absurdity.</p>\n<p>In this riveting tale, picture yourself: an unsuspecting student, armed with textbooks and caffeine, stepping into the chaotic realm of midterms. Behold the professors, masters of cryptic inquiries, who toss questions your way as if plucking them from a cosmic lottery: \"Prepare for the unknown,\" they say as if uncertainty were an appetizer before a main course of confusion.</p>\n<p>To navigate this topsy-turvy adventure, students are encouraged to find solace in the magical powers of highlighters and flash cards. Because, of course, nothing says \"I'm ready for this exam,\" like neon ink and scraps of paper. Counselors, those mystical beings, offer profound wisdom such as \"Visualize success\" and \"Imagine your stress floating away,\" as if acing a midterm were a matter of manifesting hard enough.</p>\n<p>Finding a study spot in the library becomes an epic struggle akin to claiming the Iron Throne. Desks and power outlets are holy treasures, and students engage in fierce battles armed with laptops and snacks, hoping to decode the secrets of the universe (or at least understand why the WiFi won't cooperate).</p>\n<p>But fear not, brave souls, for this chaos emerges the time-honored tradition of the caffeine-fueled all-nighter! Students, with their eyes resembling crimson stoplights and their sanity hanging by a thread, delve into the abyss of study guides and lecture notes. It's a desperate attempt to shove an entire term’s worth of information into a sleep-deprived brain because, clearly, that's the recipe for success.</p>\n<p>In this realm of academic lunacy, time loses all meaning. \"Midterm week\" stretches endlessly, blurring the lines between reality and nightmare. ’<i>Is it Week 5, or have we slipped into an alternate dimension where midterms never end?’</i> students ponder, their existential crises deepening with each passing moment.</p>\n<p>Yet, amidst the madness, a peculiar camaraderie blossoms. Strangers exchange knowing glances in the library, silently acknowledging the shared misery. Professors, too, revel in the chaos, lacing their lectures with phrases like, \"This might be on the midterm, but I wouldn't bet my coffee on it.\" Laughter tinged with a touch of hysteria echoes through the halls as students bond over the sheer mind-boggling absurdity of it all.</p>\n<p>So, dear scholars, buckle up for the Midterm Chronicles: a sarcastic roller coaster ride where brilliance and madness intertwine, and common sense takes a vacation. In the grand carnival of academia, midterms are the sideshow that never ends, and the real adventure lies in surviving the ordeal with your caffeine addiction intact. Here's to hoping your pens are mightier than confusion and your senses of humor are honed greater than a freshly sharpened pencil. Onward, to the triumph of surviving another round of academic madness!</p>",

So, imagine my humiliation when my fruit salad arrived but everyone at this Friendly-50s-Yet-Mildly-Racist-Massachusetts-Republican-themed diner decided today was the day they finally start drinking more water. Obviously, I could just tell him, turn my head, and take them out; or even dig through my bag for my liner case, foldable toothbrush, and mini toothpaste, then awkwardly wait outside the bathroom, the door to which happens to be within eyesight of my date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Naturally, being God's strongest soldier and all, I ate with them in. Once he started up on “rubber-ducking” I excused myself and picked out the pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To state the obvious, invisible aligners require maintenance. As if going to the communal bathrooms isn’t bad enough, now I have to spend 20 minutes brushing my teeth and liners, flossing, tongue scraping and mouth washing.</p>\n<p>Now imagine kissing. Instead of thinking, “Wow, I really like [Insert current obsession]!” or “Wow, [Insert Current Obsession] is terrible at this,” I’m trying to tap into my telepathy to assess whether [Insert Current Obsession] is having their tongue and lips cheese-grated because my incessant teeth grinding has caused holes and jagged bits in my trays.</p>\n<p>Many erroneously conclude invisible liners are less painful than traditional braces. But the physical pain is incomparable to the agony you experience when you accidentally throw out, lose or fail to wear your set for exactly 22 hours of the day. With that being said, next time someone suggests invisible aligners, ask yourself: Are my teeth really that bad or are they praying for my downfall?</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Modern jazz singer-songwriter Laufey captivated concert attendees at The Theatre of the Living Arts on Friday, Nov. 3 in Philadelphia. Like many other dates on The Bewitched Tour, this show was sold out. Audience members were dressed in true Laufey fashion with ribbons and bows in their hair and delicate, neutral-toned clothing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The opener, New Jersey-born indie pop artist Adam Melchor, took the stage at 8 p.m. starting off with a cover of “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/PSZxmZmBfnU?si=3duomO25enCm6CfZ\"><u>Somewhere Over The Rainbow</u></a>” (1939) by composer Harold Arlena and lyricist Yip Harburg. Purple lighting settled over the stage as Melchor debuted his pure vocals. Preceding his song “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MK7ifiq-cEA?si=rgG6W27fUhABuCiq\"><u>it’sjustmyheart (voice memo)</u></a>” off his first album “<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8KzZh6slBj4Acc_sHMtEi7MxLIineK5s&amp;si=6x8He8Oimzroxxma\"><u>Melchor Lullaby Hotline Vol. 1</u></a>” (2021), Melchor explained it was about a “person who dumped him.” He elaborated that a couple days later, a tree fell on this person’s car and they called him for assistance, which elicited a chaotic reaction from the audience. Melchor beautifully ended his set with another single, “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FZjUkwR7xKE?si=lBs_EmXkJin_uobb\"><u>Real Estate</u></a>,” (2018) that was about “finding the person you love’s hair caught in your mouth…in your clothes.” It was the perfect precursor to Laufey’s love-focused set. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaufey’s set began around 9 p.m., as she appeared on stage in a dark gray blazer and skirt, with silver metallic heels and a red guitar. The stage itself was adorned with lantern-like lights producing a warm hue. Following an instrumental intro, Laufey opened her set with “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qVudRvCCNF8?si=16qsJTVKzGiXRG6F\"><u>Fragile</u></a>” from the album “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/z2PzxLwA4rM?si=cAfcoMnmU_YcrF-X\"><u>Everything I Know About Love</u></a>” (2022). From this track, she dove into fan-favorite “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tyKu0uZS86Q?si=SDyojSYjGybz-xm0\"><u>Valentine</u></a>,” another single from the same album. All audience members were singing along for this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaufey, a trained cellist, brought out her cello for “Second Best.” This track, off the tour namesake album “<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m8CnG6tYIYTtSnNEKetlny1ksfjLNdlfE&amp;si=0GMPbkDZufk3pSh2\"><u>Bewitched</u></a>” (2023), allowed the audience to be whisked away by Laufey’s soothing voice. It also featured a cello solo on the left side of the stage, with a spotlight shining over Laufey. “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtXvK6v8OwQ?si=OibcE1NrK7-Jqt2O\"><u>Second Best</u></a>,” which is about being someone’s second choice, had everyone feeling a bit emotional. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the sadness did not last for long, as Laufey increased the energy with the track “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-xoxu1zHiSY?si=neMkM1qa42lLbo_3\"><u>Dreamer</u></a>” from the same album. “Dreamer” served as a contrast to “Second Best,” as it is about Laufey not letting anyone “kill the dreamer” in her when it comes to love. This endearing performance consisted of Laufey skipping across the stage and standing on its elevated center platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I just had a Philly cheesesteak before this,” she said as she finished her performance and expressed that she felt a bit queasy from jumping around. <br/>\n<br/>\nLeading into the track, “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ej8RhiSv2-4?si=M6o9B0NNOrClxECp\"><u>Falling Behind</u></a>” (“Everything I Know About Love”), Laufey explained that she wrote the song after seeing couples making out in coffee shops. She felt like she was behind in her life because she did not have a significant other, a sentiment many audience members related to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Laufey got further into her set, more lights appeared on stage, resembling stars. This provided a lovely atmosphere for the ballad “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/INmi-teOQLA?si=siD8SHTWy2bPwDFS\"><u>Beautiful Stranger</u></a>” (“Everything I Know About Love”). Laufey explained that the idea for this song came when she was on the train in London and made intense eye contact with a stranger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After the song’s completion she playfully stated, “You guys are so delusional,” which elicited many laughs and screams of agreement throughout the crowd. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinuing with the theme of anecdotes, Laufey revealed that her song “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Yq6qkq_TWAM?si=wElWmf2AAzVLKZy5\"><u>Promise</u></a>” (“Bewitched”) is based on a long distance situationship that she had a hard time cutting off. The crowd screamed the bridge lyrics “I’ve done the math, there’s no solution / We’ll never last / Why can’t I let go of this?” The song’s performance in full was breathtaking. <br/>\n<br/>\n“Promise” led into jazz classic “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/q0fnqat88IQ?si=aaG51LPK9UYgc4tp\"><u>Like the Movies</u></a>” from the “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xsn8fIqhk9w?si=uiDuFO4xRNaTBn8I\"><u>Typical of Me</u></a>” EP (2021). This song gained traction on TikTok upon its release, boosting Laufey’s popularity and the appreciation for modern jazz among today’s generation. Needless to say, all audience members were singing along. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it came time for the “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/50MDFvmiOBw?si=c52r1gwPbnZDwvb3\"><u>Nocturne (Interlude)</u></a>” (“Bewitched”), Laufey described that she wanted to “challenge herself to compose something that didn’t rely on lyrics or singing.” The interlude is a dazzling piano composition that seamlessly blends with the rest of the album. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe studio version of her single “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NLphEFOyoqM?si=-s1_hsfYSoDcWVoe\"><u>Let You Break My Heart Again</u></a>” (2021) is one of her most instrumentally impressive tracks as she is joined by the Philharmonia Orchestra. While the Philharmonia Orchestra was not present with her on tour, it did not stop this song from being just as exquisite live, making the audience feel as though they had transcended time. It is absolutely gut-wrenching, and conveys a level of emotion that is easy to be consumed by.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe penultimate song of her set was “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/y6-LuNQRo9E?si=uc74WHriISaPeJ-r\"><u>Lovesick</u></a>” (“Bewitched”). This track started off slow, but picked up intensely during the chorus. Laufey did a call-and-response at the end of this track, telling the right and left halves of the venue to sing “oooh” at different pitches to create harmony. The music continued to play as the audience sang their newly learned harmony, which sounded amazing for something that was learned only seconds prior. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaufey’s main set ended at 10:15 p.m., but she came back on stage for an encore shortly after. The first encore song was “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/PEOwqZoDEGI?si=_DV74I0QvkasBkyq\"><u>Letter To My 13 Year Old Self</u></a>” (“Bewitched”), which is a heartfelt track where Laufey addresses and appeases the insecurities of her 13-year-old self. When she sang the lyric “One day, you’ll be up on stage / Little girls will scream your name,” audience members screamed “Laufey!” Fans also presented a project during this track, in which they all held up letters to their 13-year-old selves in the air for Laufey to see. She was warmed by the gesture and asked if there was a way to collect the letters or if fans wanted to swap letters with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor her second encore song and last song of the night, Laufey explained that she was doing a “surprise song” for each show of her tour. This song could either be something from her discography or a cover. She chose a bit of a silly one for Philadelphia, performing a cover of “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/w2efaIcqyVY?si=fXkY6seiNObtvrAq\"><u>Makin’ Whoopee</u></a>” (1929) by Walter Donaldson, that she said she posted on her TikTok two years ago, if any early fans remembered. The show let out a bit after 10:30 p.m., and released audience members to a classic chilly November night. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaufey’s U.S. leg of The Bewitched Tour ends on Nov. 19 in L.A., before she heads to Europe in February. In the meantime, fans can stream her newly released Christmas tracks, “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bkJX7bQo8bE?si=kMOhHJsm5SLEL8ug\"><u>Christmas Dreaming</u></a>,” and a cover of “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/X_-2hYo_iCk?si=Qm_XkYLvI2ZRB9Ms\"><u>Christmas Waltz</u></a>” off her three-track single “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/55ak2rCXiq0?si=2oeODe1Nd04M61f6\"><u>A Very Laufey Holiday!</u></a>”; her two-track single with Norah Jones “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/WY6JRKeMuvM?si=Flhuyvi6kiNsCbxc\"><u>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</u></a>” and co-authored song “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_SyO4rKr0-w?si=76XKBDsz71x2ZxyN\"><u>Better Than Snow</u></a>”; and her Spotify Singles Holiday cover of “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cse28NGwOYs?si=2taz66X5CheO76GZ\"><u>Winter Wonderland</u></a>,” all released this month. <br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>SETLIST&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Adam Melchor&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Somewhere Over the Rainbow (Snippet)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7YwXnrbppvc?si=-qZNGnls0qmGvSdm\"><u>ADELAIDE</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/IBJN7Wx_Jc4?si=iJLAP4vVTnhaiCR4\"><u>Moon in the Morning</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/U1bP-NQPdQM?si=gvDxx9dMAv0ylcXA\"><u>JEWEL</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0HhwNvVSkTg?si=93v5NAdHAu0gSfZ7\"><u>itsjustmyheart</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TrGLiK4D_zU?si=FXyOeG5MJ4gPPf-G\"><u>SEROTONIN</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hCeVB2uMQS8?si=Z91PwLn5Y9z6YrR5\"><u>PEACH</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5ENYXJItPAk?si=f8q8nZPevW8ho-ML\"><u>Joyride</u></a></p>\n<p>Real Estate</p>\n<p><b>Laufey</b></p>\n<p>Fragile</p>\n<p>Valentine</p>\n<p>Second Best</p>\n<p>Dreamer</p>\n<p>Falling Behind</p>\n<p>Beautiful Stranger</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/P1V6cQJpbc4?si=3_2zapNJCbH2w__f\"><u>I Wish You Love (Keely Smith cover)</u></a></p>\n<p>Promise</p>\n<p>Like the Movies</p>\n<p>Nocturne (Interlude)</p>\n<p>Let You Break My Heart Again</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/b3sJ001W4OM?si=JDnKOT3ataV7OexC\"><u>California and Me</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/LS3Hc37qG28?si=9QL6Yhnw5WD9GSvJ\"><u>Bewitched</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fbvHtw5leqo?si=lRwqZ7HYXjP_mqJ-\"><u>Haunted</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Pf9KVHOeblE?si=FC0voOjscBSOdbQj\"><u>Best Friend</u></a></p>\n<p>Lovesick</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/VArOUfVOjqI?si=gY1Eq-jvfLyuuGJn\"><u>From the Start</u></a></p>\n<p>Letter To My 13 Year Old Self</p>\n<p>Makin' Whoopee!

Laine McGurk scored a game high 20 points, going 9-12 from the field and 2-4 from three in eighteen minutes of action. The freshman guard from West Chester, Pennsylvania played excellently in just her second collegiate game.</p>\n<p>Drexel was able to control the game through their stifling defense which prevented many of La Salle’s chances inside the paint from scoring. Drexel’s heavy press also prevented any opportunity for La Salle to score from three as the Explorers struggled to put points on the board. For eight minutes, spanning from three minutes left in the first quarter to five minutes left in the second quarter, Drexel kept La Salle from scoring at all.</p>\n<p>Rebounding played a huge role in their defense, where they outer-bounded La Salle 48-26. Drexel’s offensive rebounding also allowed them to extend their possession on the ball and gave them more opportunities to score. Drexel had fourteen offensive rebounds throughout the game led by senior forward Chloe Hodges who had six offensive rebounds for the Dragons. Hodges tacked on 14 points on 6-9 shooting.</p>\n<p>When they weren’t playing defense Drexel were always one step ahead of La Salle on offense. The Dragons shot 48% from the field and 39% from three compared to La Salle’s 32% and 10% respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether it be fast breaks, going into the paint or shooting from three, Drexel was able to put points on the board. Guard Brooke Mullin earned most of her five assists from playing the ball forward to one of her teammates.</p>\n<p>Other players like Hodges, Grace O’Neill and Momo LaClair were able to connect with their teammates by passing through open lanes or kicking out to an open teammate for an easy three points. Laine McGurk, Erin Sweeney and Amaris Baker combined for five of the Dragons’ seven three-pointers. Transfer student guard from Harcum Amaris Baker had 19 points on 8-14 shooting in 26 minutes on the court.</p>\n<p>The Dragons were able to maintain a lead over La Salle and even lead by as much as 28 at one point in the match. La Salle only lead early on in the first quarter 5-4 before Drexel took over and lead throughout the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>Triple zeros hit in the fourth as Drexel cruised to victory over the Explorers, 71-46 being the final score. The Dragons improved to 2-1 while La Salle fell to 2-2. Drexel’s next match sees them welcoming another intercity rival in the Saint Joseph’s University Hawks. The Hawks are currently 3-0 on the season and look to be formidable opponents in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>",

His postseason performance calmed these nerves, however, as Nola posted a 2.35 ERA in 23 innings, and won three games for the Phillies. With Nola being one of the best pitchers on the market this offseason the Phillies will likely have to spend big to bring Nola back for 2024.</p>\n<p>After being one of the Phillies more consistent bats since his debut in 2017, Hoskins missed the entire 2023 season with a torn ACL during spring training. In his absence, Bryce Harper, took his position at first base and excelled, hitting 10 home runs in only 36 games while manning first, and playing better defensively than Hoskins. In a press conference last Tuesday, Dombrowski said Harper was the best option to play first base, and will continue at the position. This almost fully guarantees that Hoskins will not return to the Phils in 2024, a sad piece of news for many die-hard Phillies fans.</p>\n<p>Kimbrel joined the Phillies in 2023 with a track record as one of the greatest closers in baseball history. Kimbrel earned All-Star honors and saved 23 games for the team, but his 0-2 record and 12.00 ERA in the NLCS was one of the largest contributing factors to the Phillies’ early exit to the Diamondbacks. With the Phillies getting great bullpen production from less expensive relievers like Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, and Dylan Covey, don’t expect Kimbrel to be back in red next season.</p>\n<p>Michael Lorenzen was a mid-season acquisition by the Phillies in 2023, who had put up his best numbers as a starter for the Tigers, and earned an all-star nod. Lorenzen immediately cemented himself in Phillies history by throwing a no-hitter in just his second start with the team. After that he posted an 8.02 ERA with the Phillies and was demoted to the bullpen. With the starting pitcher market expecting to be big this offseason, Lorenzen will likely take his talents elsewhere as well.</p>\n<p><b>Free Agent/Trade Targets</b></p>\n<p>With Kimbrel, Hoskins and Lorenzen likely on their way out of Philadelphia, and a few spots still needing addressing this offseason, who are some players the Phillies could target this winter?</p>\n<p><b>Blake Snell, LHP, 30-years-old</b>: Snell is a two-time Cy Young winner, including in 2023, and led all of baseball with a 2.25 ERA this past season. If the Phillies decide not to give Nola a monster contract, Snell could also be worthy of a big contract, and could add another big piece to the Phillies rotation.</p>\n<p><b>Sonny Gray, RHP, 34-years-old</b>: A 3x All-Star, Gray had his best season in 4 years with the Twins, posting a 2.79 ERA, and 183 strikeouts. Gray could be too expensive for the smaller budget Twins, so the Phillies could swoop in and grab an uber-consistent arm like Gray to help their rotation in 2024.</p>\n<p><b>Yoshinobu Yamamoto, RHP, 25-years-old: </b>The Nippon Professional Baseball League ace will be posted for MLB teams to sign in the coming weeks, and the Phillies are reportedly going to be heavily interested in signing the Japanese phenom. Yamamoto helped Japan win the World Baseball classic in 2023, and would be a huge addition to the Phillies rotation.</p>\n<p><b>Shohei Ohtani, RHP/DH, 29-years-old: </b>Arguably the most talented baseball player of all time will be available this winter, and every team should have varying levels of interest, including the Phillies. It may be hard to find a spot in the lineup for Ohtani given he can only hit as the DH, but if a player of his caliber is willing to come to Philadelphia, arrangements will be made to make it work.</p>\n<p><b>Josh Hader, LHP, 29-years-old: </b>After the bullpen was a huge strength for most of the regular season and postseason, the group struggled towards the end of the NLCS, contributing to the Phillies' crushing loss. The team may look to make a splash in that department, and Hader is a solid fit. The hard-throwing lefty has long been a target of President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski, and he has a shot to land him this offseason.</p>\n<p><b>Kevin Kiermaier, OF, 33-years-old</b>: With Harper moving to first base full time, and the atrocious defender in Kyle Schwarber likely moving to the designated hitter role, the Phillies could look to add another outfielder. Kiermaier would be a perfect fit, as the four-time gold glove winner would immediately add another bat to the Phillies lineup, and add some much needed defense to a poor-defensive outfield at Citizens Bank.</p>\n<p>The Phillies have a lot of questions to answer, but as an attractive free agent destination and having an elite core of players already in place, with a good off-season there is no reason to believe this team won’t be right back in the postseason next year fighting for another World Series title.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>\"The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical\" is adapted from the hit Rick Riordan novel \"The Lightning Thief.\" The story follows teenager Percy Jackson discovering he is the son of Poseidon. He visits Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for other demigods, before departing on a quest to avoid war breaking out among the Greek gods. The show, with music and lyrics by Rob Rokicki and book by Joe Tracz, debuted in 2017 and played a limited run on Broadway two years later. Last Friday, Nov. 10, the musical opened at Drexel University’s Mandell Theater.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the highlight of the show is the stellar student performers, most notably the three leads: Nic Fallacaro as Percy Jackson, Dana David as Annabeth and Aiden Abiuso as Grover. Additional standouts from the rest of the cast include Morgan McNulty as Clarisse, a daughter of Ares and Christopher Martinez as Luke, a son of Hermes.</p>\n<p>Despite the show’s evidently low budget and ambitious fantasy content, the special effects are remarkably strong. The impressive minotaur puppet and a very fun ensemble-wide fight scene during an intense round of Capture the Flag are particularly exciting moments. The use of vocal effects to portray the titan Kronos and the oracle are also rather compelling. The set is somewhat disjointed—equal parts Greek-inspired columns and industrial scaffolding—but is utilized well enough by the staging to be effective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the musical itself holds the show back—Rokicki and Tracz’s writing attempts to make a point about neglectful parenting. The “Campfire Song” number, in which the ensemble gripes about the gods never having time for their kids, comes closest to striking a chord. Still, ultimately the bland lyrics and poor pacing make for a show that would better appeal to younger children than a university-aged audience.</p>\n<p>The direction by Kyle Metzger leans into the show’s younger appeal. In some cases, the result is campy and entertaining, as in Poseidon’s reunion with Percy and Sally, Percy’s mother. Other scenes, like a musical trip to the underworld featuring Kurt Cobain’s ghost, come off as immature.</p>\n<p>Opening night of the musical coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Mandell Theater, which premiered its first show on Nov. 10, 1973. Among last Friday’s audience were cast members from the Mandell Theater’s first production and the director who inaugurated the theater. After the performance, a reception honored the former members of the Drexel Theatre Company, as well as the fabulous cast of \"The Lightning Thief\" continuing their legacy.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\"The Lightning Thief\" runs through Nov. 18. Tickets can be purchased via the Drexel Performing Arts website.</p>",

They also have the chance to explore other areas of research that interest them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“My most prominent connection is with my mentor, and by doing the program, I was able to get an opportunity in her lab to not only work on my STAR project but independent research as well,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>LSAMP’s policies welcome STEM-focused students to sign up and benefit from the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was not too hard,” Smith added. “I think an important thing about LSAMP is how easy it is to get in, so it shows they are not excluding them from the kinds of resources they provide.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LSAMP is also dedicated to keeping a student’s STEM interest alive by constantly exposing them to new ideas, research topics and famous researchers they can learn from.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Stephen Cox, regional director for LSAMP in the Greater Philadelphia area, “It has been my experience that how students find out about this is really through immersion, because unless you are in an environment where there are scientists or are talking about scientists, your interest is somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>LSAMP hopes to keep attracting and helping more students grow their research goals and reframe how people view marginalized student groups in STEM.</p>\n<p>“If they want to have more students of an underrepresented nature engaged in STEM at their institution, then they need to spread the word,” added Cox. “It is an institutional priority that will make this work better; no one individual can change everything, but an educational philosophy can change how we do business.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This conference marks another year of LSAMP, providing an inclusive environment for STEM-focused students to flourish in their research goals. The program perseveres as a prime example of how students with a proper platform can excel and inspire a new generation that success is possible with the right connections and resources.</p>\n<p>“Probably the most important thing in terms of pride and a feeling of success is when [alums] come back, who we call the men of honor and women of distinction, have finished their PhDs, who have gone on to teach [and] work in industry, and to [have created] a whole new life for themselves and their communities,” Cox said.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Primaries are the elections that take place early in an election year to decide who each party will nominate as their chosen candidate for the general election in November. An open primary voting system is simple and easy to understand. Anyone can vote in the primary election regardless of their registered party if an open primary system is used. This is beneficial because it allows more people to participate in the political process – specifically independents who are an important voting bloc in the general election. Registered independent voters don’t necessarily lack a preferred party. They just prefer to keep an open mind when it comes to who they vote for on election day. Because independent voters are not allowed to vote in Pennsylvania primaries their preferred candidate may lose before the general election. This results in more contempt for the eventual nominees as independent voters become frustrated with the fact they never got to vote for their preferred candidate. With this in mind, we must switch to an open primary voting system that allows all community members to have a say in who the eventual nominees will be.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania is a closed primary state. According to the Committee of Seventy, closed primaries guarantee “that fewer voters participate, elections are less competitive and, ultimately, political polarization is reinforced, contributing to legislative gridlock and hampering good governance.” The nonprofit advocacy group Open Primaries is also fighting to remove barriers to voting in the primary. According to Open Primaries, “Millions of independent voters—the fastest growing segment of the electorate—are excluded from voting in closed partisan primaries.”<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2021/11/24/some_surprising_facts_about_college_students_politics_804971.html\"><u> This statement is especially true on universities where the majority of students do not identify themselves as either Republican or Democrat. </u></a>A primary system that prohibits independents from voting is a system that chooses to silence the voices of over 50% of students. Historically, parties had much more power over who the eventual nominees were. Now, the general public is much more involved in the nominating process. It is unfair that a large swath of the population is not allowed to vote in the primary simply because they do not want to register with a party. In the mayoral primary that took place on May 16, 2023, only about 27% of Philadelphia’s population participated in the primary election. Voter turnout last week was just under 31% of the city. This low turnout rate would likely increase if more people were allowed to participate in Philadelphia’s primary. Outdated systems must be updated to fit the changing times.</p>\n<p>Jared Solomon, a state representative and candidate for attorney general, is trying to update our primary system. A bill proposed by Solomon (H.B. 979) passed through the state government committee last month and has bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During an interview, Solomon said, “Any bill that increases accessibility to the polls moves us towards a more accessible voting system.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Solomon went on to say that he would use his position as attorney general to elevate issues regarding voting rights, though admitted the powers of the office were somewhat limited with regard to open primaries. This means that Solomon is doing his part to increase voter accessibility, but also cannot be the sole advocate for this issue. It is on all of us to do our part and advocate for an open primary system by contacting our elected officials.</p>\n<p>Open primaries are the first step towards other reforms including ranked choice voting and same day voter registration. If Jared and his allies are successful, Pennsylvania will join a growing list of states that do not disenfranchise voters with unnecessary barriers to vote in the primary. The benefits are clear, but it will require a strong effort on our part to make this change happen.<a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/\"><u> If you support open primaries in any capacity, please contact your state representative </u></a>and let them know you support Jared Solomon’s bill (H.B. 979) to create a better primary system that everyone can participate in.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Drexel Dragons suffered a hard-fought loss in their Home Opener and 1st home Big 5 game last Tuesday, 66-64.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Temple’s rookie Head Coach, Adam Fisher, said it best: “The Big 5 is a battle.”</p>\n<p>The Dragons opened the game strong, with some incredible defense, taking a 10-3 lead through the first five minutes of the game. Their roll was slowed slightly by the efforts of senior forward Sam Hofman, the Houston Christian transfer, and freshman guard Zion Stanford, who helped Temple take the lead, which they never gave back.</p>\n<p>Temple led by as many as 14 in the first half, running away on a 11-0 run, but Drexel Grad Student Luke House helped the Dragons fight back with 13 first-half points on 3/3 shooting from behind the arc. House would finish the game with 20, leading the Dragons in scoring, and posting the second highest total of his career at Drexel.</p>\n<p>The second half started with more promise as sophomore Justin Moore, who hit a game winner with 2.1 seconds last Saturday against Winthrop, and House led Drexel to a 5-0 run, making it 32-29.</p>\n<p>The second half was a back-and-forth battle between the teams, with Hysier Miller leading the scoring for Temple, and Yame Butler providing some clutch buckets for the Dragons. Temple led 59-51 with just over a minute to go, before two Luke House free throws and a Justin Moore three brought the score to 62-56.</p>\n<p>With under 20 seconds to go, Justin Moore’s fast break and-one made it a three-point game, followed by a Lamar Oden Jr. layup off an inbound play to make it 64-63 with seven seconds left.</p>\n<p>In the final seconds, Kobe Magee intentionally fouled Hysier Miller, who hit 2/2 from the line. Up by three, Temple’s Miller intentionally fouled Justin Moore with 4 seconds to play, bringing him to the line. Moore sunk his first, as the DAC crowd went nuts. Down by two now, the sophomore would have to intentionally miss the second free throw in order to give the Dragons a chance to tie the game. His second attempt was a perfect miss and big man Amari Williams was able to secure the rebound. As he fell amongst the cluster of bodies in front of the basket, Williams missed the put back attempt, ending the game with a score of 66-64 in the Owls favor.</p>\n<p>Drexel played a much better second-half than the first, outscoring Temple 39-34, and shooting a much improved 45.2% from the field and 90% from the line. Luke House ended the game with 20 for the Dragons, and Moore finished with 18, 13 of which came in the second half.</p>\n<p>Although it was a tough defeat, the crowd did not disappoint in Drexel’s first home Big 5 game in school history. The game was completely sold out for the general public, and featured a student section that was so packed some students were turned away from the door. The crowd’s energy aided the Dragons in some key moments. When asked about the energy at the DAC, Temple coach Adam Fisher was impressed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This was a great atmosphere; any time you go on the road especially in the Big 5 is awesome. We knew going into it the place was going to be rocking,” said Fisher.</p>\n<p>The Dragons play their next game tonight, Nov. 17, at 7 p.m. at the DAC. They take on the Fairfield Stags (1-2), whose only win so far has come against Division III, Mount St. Mary’s College.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p><a href=\"https://cybersecurityguide.org/online/cybersecurity-bachelors-degree/\">Cybersecurity Guide’s</a> new rankings place Drexel University’s online bachelor's in computing and security technology second in online cybersecurity degrees for 2024.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cybersecurityguide.org/\">Cybersecurity Guide</a> is an online resource run by renowned cybersecurity professionals in the industry and academia. Their rankings of top cybersecurity programs are based on a number of factors, such as graduation rates, tuition costs, admission rates and student-faculty ratio. Drexel’s program, which boasts useful hands-on experience and core concepts reinforced through practical work experience, placed second among 58 schools with online cybersecurity degree programs. However, just two years ago, Drexel barely made it onto Cybersecurity Guide’s Top 25 rankings at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chris Lenihan, head of marketing at Cybersecurity Guide, offered some insight as to why Drexel has shot up through the rankings in the past two years:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Drexel’s Cybersecurity program is ranked #2, which is outstanding. The factors that most contributed to this year’s rankings were strong graduation rates and a favorable student-faculty ratio.” Lenihan said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lenihan also added that Drexel’s designation as a <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Academics/Centers-of-Academic-Excellence/\">\"National Center for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity”</a> by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Administration, an award Drexel has held for about 20 years, significantly increases Drexel’s ranking when compared to other schools.</p>\n<p>Lenihan emphasized that Drexel’s improved ranking is primarily due to its focus on positive student outcomes. High graduation rates combined with a priority of real-world experience set Drexel apart from other schools around the country. Cybersecurity students at Drexel are equipped with a diverse skill set, incorporating areas like network security, cryptography, ethical hacking and incident response.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s online program now works in tandem with their in-person program, giving all students access to the same hands-on resources, including labs, servers and virtual environments. The labs prepare all students with the foundational knowledge necessary for cybersecurity and system administration.</p>\n<p>Jordan Prince, a third year computing and security technology major, pursued a networking certification because of his networking administration classes that he took during his freshman year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prince recalled one assignment he particularly enjoyed where he got first-hand experience “configuring switches and routers and setting up an entire network.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armed with the hands-on knowledge from his classes and co-op experiences, he was able to land an information security internship at the Philadelphia International Airport. Jordan recommended that students pursue cybersecurity for the vast technical knowledge and the high salary that comes along with that.</p>\n<p>Both Prince and the Bachelor's CST Program Director Chris Carroll stated that “anyone can and should learn cybersecurity.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone has data to protect — even a basic understanding of cybersecurity can benefit any career. Carroll specifically called out business majors and biology majors, saying that “new work in biology is very computer-centric, they need to store and analyze that data. They need to understand how IT works.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As more and more jobs become increasingly reliant on big data, understanding information technology becomes crucial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you’re in another field, cybersecurity is really not a bad minor to take,” says Carroll. “Computers run the world now so if you understand the way computers work, it really helps you.”</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Four key Drexel club sports staff members resigned from their positions this past June through Sept. Some club sports staff positions still remain vacant as we near the end of the fall term while other key roles have been filled.</p>\n<p>Matthew Moran, former club sports coordinator, was the first staff member to resign on June 3 of this year. In his final email to student club sport leaders, Moran wrote “I want [to] again thank you all for your hard work and dedication to your clubs…It is very bittersweet to be moving on, but I know this program will continue to thrive and accomplish great things.”</p>\n<p>A little over a month later, former Club Sports Assistant Director Kristen Sullivan sent an email to student club sports officers stating her resignation that eventually took place July 26. Sullivan was at Drexel for only 14 months, but helped implement an organized tier system to track club sport engagement.</p>\n<p>One month later, Bridget Wiseley, former Head Athletic Trainer, and Andrew Flanigan, former Assistant Athletic Trainer, sent an email to the same student club sports leaders announcing their resignation. Wiseley was part of the club sports staff for over a decade, and sent a very heartfelt message expressing her gratitude towards her experience as a Dragon. Flanigan’s last day as the Assistant Athletic Trainer was Aug. 30 and Wiseley’s last day as the Head Athletic Trainer was Sept. 8.</p>\n<p>With four key positions left vacant, it was up to James Rogers, newly made Director of University Recreation, to handle the hiring process of a brand new staff with the fall term approaching.</p>\n<p>Rogers introduced Orlin Jespersen, new Assistant Director of Intramural and Club Sports on Oct. 2 to student club sports officers in an email. Before becoming a Dragon, Jespersen worked in leadership roles at Cabrini University for almost 20 years – most notably working as the Senior Associate Director of Athletics and Recreation for Operations and External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Most recently, Zachary Apt, newly made Club Sports Manager, was introduced to student club sports officers by Jespersen on Oct. 30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think the question many are eager to know is: why were these positions left so abruptly and all almost simultaneously? And how have the vacant positions affected clubs sports teams processes and procedures? There are many questions left unanswered about the former leaders, however, with new leadership in place, I think it is safe to say all club sports athletes are excited to see what, or who, is to come in the future.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In Hollywood, there is often an evident correlation between a given filmmaker’s popularity and the scope of their projects, with both factors typically increasing alongside each other. “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80234448\"><u>The Killer</u></a>” stands unflinchingly as a deviant to this pattern. Based on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420034642/http://www.archaia.com/blog/titles/the-killer\"><u>French comic book</u></a> of the same name, “The Killer”, released Nov. 10 as a Netflix exclusive, is the newest addition to the portfolio of legendary director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/\"><u>David Fincher</u></a>. Known for such renowned films as “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/\"><u>Fight Club</u></a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/\"><u>Se7en</u></a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/\"><u>Zodiac</u></a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/\"><u>The Social Network</u></a><u>,</u>” Fincher returns to the crime-thriller genre with “The Killer.” Given his prestige, he demonstrates an unexpected sense of restraint. Forgoing the persistent suspense and nail-biting mystery commonly associated with this genre, the film relishes its bare-bones simplicity. In doing so, while perhaps failing to be as widely captivating as Fincher’s previous works, it provides a fresh spin on a tired narrative framework.</p>\n<p>“The Killer” follows an unnamed perfectionist assassin, portrayed by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1055413/\"><u>Michael Fassbender</u></a>, after he fails to complete a job requested by a mysterious client known as Claybourne. Upon returning to Santo Domingo, he discovers that Claybourne’s subordinates have prematurely broken into his home to deliver punishment for this shortcoming, an incident that leaves his girlfriend severely injured. Consequently, the Killer sets out on a relentless, violent hunt for those involved in the break-in, where he gradually loses sight of the apathetic attitude he believes necessary for his line of work.</p>\n<p>Though the film’s description on paper is derivative of countless other revenge-driven stories, “The Killer” distinguishes itself through its unwavering commitment to immersing viewers in the unique perspective of its titular protagonist. The film’s opening chapter makes this objective abundantly clear, closely following the Killer as he stakes out the target for the aforementioned job in Paris. Markedly uneventful in terms of plot progression, the opening segment focuses on providing meaningful insight into the protagonist’s psyche via a series of internal monologues. Applied throughout the remainder of the film, this approach accomplishes spades in fleshing out his cold, calculating demeanor and establishing the largely dull procedural nature with which he views his profession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The slow, methodical presentation of the story remains consistently anchored by Fassbender’s subdued performance. Fassbender brilliantly captures the callous analytic behavior of the Killer, while also communicating an emotional subtlety that prevents the character from feeling like a one-note caricature. When paired with the sheer amount of focus that is placed on the protagonist above all other aspects of the film, this believability adds a sense of compelling discomfort as viewers essentially become one with the Killer along his journey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fincher’s unconventionally dull approach to this type of narrative is not without its moments of excitement. However, much like other aspects of the film, these sequences are noticeably stripped down, strengthening the link between events as the Killer experiences them and viewers’ perceptions of those events. For example, early on in the film, the Killer is forced to escape from his hideout and evade the incoming law enforcement on a motorbike. One would reasonably expect this scene to become a high-intensity chase with flashy cinematography, a heart-pounding score and enthralling vehicle choreography. The film instead presents a much more minimal sequence, showing the Killer avoiding police at a brisk pace with a soundscape only consisting of the hum of vehicle engines and distant sirens interspersed with the protagonist’s mildly uneasy breathing. Lacking the theatrics expected from a scene of this ilk, it effectively communicates the Killer’s quiet, internal panic in an unfamiliar situation. A similar minimalist ideology is employed throughout the rest of the film, creating a cold and distant atmosphere that complements the titular character.</p>\n<p>A bold addition to Fincher’s iconic filmography, “The Killer” directly juxtaposes with the director’s previous works of the same overarching genre. In presenting a story that is intentionally slow-paced and unexciting at the surface, the film exudes an unbothered confidence that reflects the attitude of the Killer himself. While the film’s understated quality will likely leave some viewers unsatisfied, others will take comfort in its distinct simplicity.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The world lost Matthew Perry, possibly one of the finest comedy actors of our time on Oct. 28. At age 54, Perry was found in a Los Angeles hot tub, leading authorities to deem his cause of death “apparent drowning.” While shocking and extremely heartbreaking news, it is important to focus on the monumental legacy Perry left behind. Ever since his acting debut, especially while playing the iconic Chandler Bing in “Friends,” Perry integrated important life lessons throughout his performances, all while filling audiences with laughter, love and joy.</p>\n<p>In “The One With All The Cheesecakes” (Season 7, Episode 11), Chandler shows that nothing heals the soul quite like a delicious dessert. In this episode, a mysterious cheesecake is accidentally delivered to Chandler’s apartment, leading both him and Jennifer &nbsp;Aniston’s character, Rachel Greene, to indulge in, and soon obsess over, the delicacy. As the two prove, a little something sweet is the perfect cure for any day that has gone sour.</p>\n<p>Season 5, Episode 12, “The One With Chandler’s Work Laugh,” gives viewers a look into the more professional side of Chandler. In an effort to hide his annoyance with his coworkers and suck up to his boss, Bing develops a phony “work laugh” and puts it on display during a holiday office party. Chandler’s efforts to fit in teach viewers that one should not have to hide their personality in order to be respected by those around them (even by those who are deemed important and influential).</p>\n<p>“The One Where No One’s Ready” (Season 3, Episode 2) is a perfect example of the silly antics often seen on “Friends.” In this episode, Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) is being honored at an important award ceremony, but getting the group out the door proves almost impossible. Amongst the crazy slew of events Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler argue over a plush armchair in Monica Geller’s (Courtney Cox) living room. Chandler, even given Joey’s persistent nagging, fervently defends his chair. It goes to show that no force is stronger than the want for coziness and comfort.</p>\n<p>Season 4, Episode 8, “The One With Chandler In A Box,” portrays Chandler as a role model when it comes to being a loyal friend. Once Chandler pursues a relationship with one of Joey’s girlfriends, the friends get into an argument, leading Chandler to repent his doings in a wooden box. Chandler reveals that a true friendship is worth fighting for — even if the methods to defend it are a little unconventional.</p>\n<p>In “The One With The Embryos” (Season 4 Episode 12), Chandler and Joey face off against Rachel and Monica in a jeopardy-style game to determine who knows who better. Both pairs place ridiculous bets, but in the end, the boys emerge victorious. In high-pressure situations like this one, Chandler and Joey reinforce the idea that trust and teamwork are the best ways to ensure success.</p>\n<p>Season 3, Episode 11, “The One Where Chandler Can’t Remember Which Sister,” is a hysterical episode in which Chandler fails to identify which of Joey’s seven sisters he kissed while drunk. Joey’s comical emotions throughout the events mixed with Chandler’s wild attempts to fix his wrongdoings are incredibly entertaining. Bing’s struggles serve to honor the old saying “keep your wits about you.” With a steady mind and focused attitude, one can never go wrong.</p>\n<p>“The One Where Chandler Takes A Bath” (Season 8, Episode 13) best highlights how relatable Chandler’s character truly is. Monica, seeing Chandler’s unusually anxious nature, advises him to take a warm, calming bath. At first, Bing is in denial but soon learns to love the relaxation and tranquility Monica’s suggestion brings. After stressful and overwhelming moments, viewers should remember Chandler’s experience and partake in some good old-fashioned self-care.</p>\n<p>Season 4, Episode 15, “The One With All The Rugby,” is a fan favorite due to the hilarious drama between Chandler and his then-girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler). Once he finds out that Janice has no intention of leaving him, Chandler catches a flight to Yemen in a desperate attempt to leave her. Sometimes, the best way to remedy a strained relationship is time apart. Some space might be just the right thing to foster deeper affection and pave the way for better communication.</p>\n<p>“The One Where Eddie Won't Go” (Season 2, Episode 19) rings most true for college students. In this episode, Chandler struggles to get rid of his annoying new roommate after Joey moves out. Incredibly creepy and unnerving, Eddie is everything to be feared in a roommate. The strained relationship between the two is a perfect example of what can happen when careful planning is not put into choosing a roommate. Put in the time and be sure to pick the best roommate(s) for your personality.</p>\n<p>Season 2, Episode 3, “The One Where Heckles Dies,” the friends mourn the death of their upstairs neighbor. Afraid of ending up alone, Chandler vies for a relationship. He ends up asking out a girl with a noticeably large head. With the help of his friends, Chandler soon realizes that he should not be afraid of the girl’s appearance, because it could end up impacting the outcome of the date. Take it from Chandler Bing: one should never judge a book by its cover. If you do, you could be missing out on something extraordinary.</p>\n<p>Rewatching “Friends” is the perfect way to relive these moments and more. The world will always remember Matthew Perry not just for his talent as an actor, but for his admirable persistence, kindness and pure heart. Take these lessons straight from Perry himself and honor the incomparable soul he was.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Fresh off his first Oscar nomination, Barry Keoghan joins Jacob Elordi in \"Saltburn,\" Emerald Fennell’s second directorial feature.</p>\n<p>The movie follows Oliver Quick (Keoghan), a scholarship student at Oxford University, who befriends the wealthy Felix Catton (Elordi). Due to some unforeseen circumstances, Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer with him in \"Saltburn.\" While there, Oliver interacts with Felix’s eccentric family, including Felix’s family friend Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe), sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), mother Lady Elsbeth Clatton (Rosamund Pike), and father Sir James Clatton (Richard E. Grant).</p>\n<p>\"Saltburn\" relies heavily on its aesthetic. If you have seen any promotional posters or trailers you know this movie would be a favorite on Tumblr. Its cinematography shines most through its use of reflections and mirrors, creating a visual motif of duality to represent the true nature of its characters. \"Saltburn\" is truly a beautiful film.</p>\n<p>The most controversial part of \"Saltburn\" is how explicit certain scenes are. It seems that in this day and age with shows like Euphoria, the best way to grab attention is to be explicit. When asked about this, Fennel said the sex scenes are necessary as they are the “very center of what this film is about” and noted that everyone is going to react to explicit scenes differently.</p>\n<p>Pike was easily the standout star of the movie. Her clever wit cuts through her scenes and gives a satirical approach to her icy matriarch role. It will not be surprising to see her name thrown around during awards season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Saltburn\" has a limited theatrical release on Nov. 14 and an expanded release on Nov. 22.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Less than four months after being announced as the head coach for Drexel’s men’s soccer team, Mark Fetrow has resigned.</p>\n<p>Fetrow has left to take the head coaching position at Villanova, where he was the former associate head coach before coming to Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under Fetrow, the team went 9-2-5 overall and 3-2-3 in the conference, which earned them the 5th seed in the CAA tournament. In the quarterfinals, they lost to Delaware by penalty kicks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://villanova.com/news/2023/11/16/carlin-to-retire-fetrow-named-head-coach-of-mens-soccer.aspx\"><u>press release</u></a> from Villanova, Fetrow said, “I am elated to be named the next Head Men's Soccer coach at Villanova University.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said that “I want to extend my gratitude to Maisha Kelly, Nick Gannon, and Drexel University for providing me with my first head coaching position. I am confident that the Dragons will continue to thrive, and I sincerely wish all the players and staff members nothing but the best in their future endeavors.\"</p>\n<p>It has been a rocky year for the players on the soccer team. This has been the second coaching change of 2023, as former head coach Michael Marchiano stepped down weeks before the fall preseason started to take a head coaching job at Loyola Blakefield High School in Maryland.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ben Weller, a sophomore forward on the team expressed disappointment at the sudden departure of Fetrow and the uncertainty this brings the team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With two coaching changes in the last year there is definitely a feeling of uncertainty with what will happen next,” said Weller.</p>\n<p>However, he is confident that his team will be able to overcome this challenge, saying “It is hard to have so much change, but also we have proven that we can deal with a change like this and still find success. As a team we will be just as close as always and be able to play at our best . . . We will support each other and become a team that relies on each other even more.”</p>\n<p>\"We are disappointed that Coach Fetrow's time with our program has ended so quickly,\" stated Director of Athletics Maisha Kelly. \"While we appreciate the outcome of the season, after the departure of our previous head coach, our goals and commitments are centered on a group of talented student-athletes who deserve a long-term commitment to them and their success. We have never wavered from that, including in our efforts to retain Coach Fetrow.”</p>\n<p>The search for the next head coach will begin immediately.&nbsp;</p>",
