            "body_html": "<p>eRay Ban and Meta announced a partnership last year to sell high quality smart glasses. The glasses include two cameras and allow the user to record videos and take pictures discreetly. This idea is a &nbsp;nightmarish development in the expanding invasion of privacy that is quickly taking over our lives. As TikTok has become more popular the quest for likes has resulted in people recording every simple interaction they can in the hopes of getting that sweet validation so many desperately crave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of living in the moment and enjoying the goofy company of close friends, every word or action now needs to be carefully self-monitored to prevent yourself from becoming a viral laughingstock. Every mistake a person makes, joke a person tells, or awkward moment someone has is now at risk of being blasted over the internet for millions to see. The mistakes of our past are doomed to haunt us as self-righteous observers pick up their pitchforks to attack those they deem immoral after watching a 30 second TikTok video. Just as frustrating are the secret recordings of people who do not realize they are being made fun of for the entertainment of strangers.</p>\n<p>It is a universal truth that everyone has said something they wish they didn’t say or done something they wish they did not do. In the past, these moments could be easily forgotten. Now, it seems as though even the most mundane activities need to be choreographed and filmed like we are all actors in an episode of \"Girls\" The ability to create narratives from short clips has allowed people to villainize others they don’t like. One famous example of this is the video recording of Douglas Levison yelling at a trumpet player in New York City. Levison has said in interviews after the incident that he was frustrated with the noisy trumpet player for almost hitting him with his bike. Levison’s reaction was certainly overkill, but the mountain of insults calling him ugly, short and a goblin were equally uncalled for because no one knew what happened before the camera was recording. Levison went on to lampoon himself in the film Heaven Knows What, demonstrating he at least has a sense of humor about the incident.</p>\n<p>In some cases, recording people is no doubt a good thing. During the 2020 murder of George Floyd a cell phone recording provided the critical evidence needed to convict police officer Derek Chauvin and send him to prison. This is one of the greatest examples of when recording something yields positive results – in this case, the conviction of a murderer. Technological advancements, including more abundant cameras, do have the potential to improve our lives when it comes to crime prevention. Video evidence can assist in proving or disproving guilt in the case of serious crimes. That being said, convicting someone who committed a crime is very different from recording your wannabe comedian friend doing an insensitive standup routine. Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and others are now holding piles of dirt on people that have in many cases been used to destroy the lives of good people. The same people who cast the heaviest judgment upon those who they deem immoral or wrong are in reality just waiting their turn to sit in the same exact hot seat. We have all gotten upset at someone and overreacted or said something awkward. That is why there are so many memes that literally joke about this very fact.</p>\n<p>Think before you pull out your phone. Ask yourself this important question, “will anyone care about this as much as I do?” If the answer is not an enthusiastic “yes” then do yourself and others a favor. Stop recording every moment you have and posting it on the internet. You may not realize it now, but we do not yet live in a world that forgives the common mistakes of people. Save the camera for truly important moments because we live in a world that is constantly looking for the next person to hate and using social media to find them. This reality is unfortunately very dangerous for our futures.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Every year, billions of people commit themselves to New Year’s Resolutions. With the new year came a new slate for Drexel’s Basketball teams, and I took the responsibility upon myself to make some of the Dragons’ lives easier by coming up with their resolutions for them.</p>\n<p><b>Mate Okros: Make some history</b></p>\n<p>When I sat down to interview Coach Zack Spiker right before the basketball season began, he told me that Mate Okros would be in the opening night starting five. This took me by surprise because Okros, while a talented player, has had multiple chances at being a starter without much success in that role. Spiker explained this decision with a bold proclamation: that Okros would enter Drexel Men’s Basketball top 10 in career 3-point baskets made. Entering the season, Okros needed 47 made 3’s to crack the top 10. For the first ten games of the season, Okros only made six three-pointers on just 18 attempts. In the last eight games, however, Okros has made 18 threes on 37 attempts. Unsurprisingly, in those past eight games, the Dragons have seven wins. If Okros keeps shooting the ball, he can help lead the Dragons to postseason success while collecting individual accomplishments.</p>\n<p><b>Yame Butler: Get back in a groove</b></p>\n<p>It would not be hyperbolic to say the Yame Butler single handedly saved the 2022-2023 Drexel Basketball season. Butler dazzled the DAC with his tight handles and knack for getting to the rim and finishing through anyone in his way. Part of his skillset was also his shooting. Last season, Butler shot 45% from three-point range, and 87% from the free throw line. This season, however, Butler is shooting just 22% from deep and 68% from the charity stripe. Butler is one of a select few Dragons who can create his own shot through his dribbling ability and athleticism, and there's no stopping this offense if Butler can return to the form he has proven capable of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amari Williams: Play 30 minutes</b></p>\n<p>Amari Williams is the best player on the Dragons roster and can be the best player in the CAA if he wants to be. If you were to look at Amari’s statistics, however, you might think he is underperforming. As a wildly athletic, nearly seven-foot center, Williams probably should be averaging more than 12 points and 8 rebounds per game. However, when you consider the fact that Williams’ season high in minutes is 32, and he averages just 21 minutes, those statistics jump off the page a whole lot more. Williams’ health has to be preserved, and there is no sense in subjecting your star center to needless abuse in games that are not close. However, with important postseason games on the horizon, it is entirely likely that the Dragons will need Williams to stay on the court for over 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><b>Chloe Hodges: Get a double-double</b></p>\n<p>After averaging five points-per-game last season, Hodges has cemented herself as a crucial player for the Dragons. The Senior forward has had some explosive offensive performances, most notably her 21 point showing against Northeastern earlier in January. However, as one of the few players above 6 feet tall on Drexel Women's Basketball team, Hodges also has an important role as a rebounder. She is the team’s leader in collected boards, and she has amassed seven rebounds on five separate occasions. While Amaris Baker recently collected the team’s first double-double of the season, it is Hodges who most frequently flirts with that impressive statline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Grace O'Neill: Level up</b></p>\n<p>In her freshman season, O’Neill turned heads as a jack-of-all-trades point guard who chipped in on every single column of the stat sheet. While this is still true in her sophomore year, O’Neill is averaging less points, steals and rebounds, all while shooting at a significantly less efficient clip. The Dragons are a formidable team and O’Neill is a big part of that, but if they hope to make some noise in 2024, she will have to not only regain her previous level, but raise it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amy Mallon: Find some more points</b></p>\n<p>While Mallon has put in a terrific effort to get her roster playing as well as she has, one area that can improve is the offense. While the Dragons have still scored more points than they’ve let up, their offense is far from lethal. As a team, the Dragons have shot just over 40% from the field and 30% from deep. In the CAA, Drexel is 11th out of the 14 schools in average points per game. One change could lie in freshman Laine McGurk who is 8th in minutes played yet 4th in points-per-game.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Despite it being nearly five years since 21 Savage released his last solo album, he has never strayed far from the spotlight in that time. This could be a result of the ridiculous feature run he has been on the last few years on what feels like every album that comes out. Or it could be because of his massively successful collaborative albums, such as 2020’s \"Savage Mode 2\" with producer Metro Boomin’, or 2022’s \"Her Loss,\" a partnership with Drake. It could also be because of what 21 gets up to outside of music, most notably his 2019 arrest, due to the fact that he was essentially an illegal immigrant, having moved to the United States from England nearly 20 years ago while having no documentation for a majority of that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This whole situation was seemingly the inspiration for his new album, titled \"American Dream.\" For the first time since 2018, 21 is back in the saddle, and throughout the album, it is clear that 21 and only 21 was in control of the creative choices. Sometimes this leads to moments that although unexpected, definitely work, and are worth the risk. However, these chances often fall flat, resulting in songs that are not necessarily bad, but just not what anyone wants to hear from 21.</p>\n<p>The album begins with a spoken-word intro from 21 Savage’s mother, with her discussing the risks they took that allowed 21 to be who he is, presumably referring to their decision to immigrate to the U.S., or even to the struggles that they faced well after moving. In the next song, titled “All of Me,” 21 dives right into those struggles in traditional 21 fashion, giving an extremely detailed look into what he’s been through, which, according to him involved a lot of violence, murder and loss. The next song, “redrum” (\"murder\" backward), sees 21 go even further into these topics. On the hook, Savage continuously repeats the line “G block, all we know is redrum,” implying that where he grew up, murder and violence were normal, if not necessary in order to make it out, a stark contrast to the idea of the American dream.</p>\n<p>Savage switches up his energy on the next few songs, starting with “n.h.i.e.,” with an unexpected feature from Doja Cat. Although he sings about similar subject matter to the last few songs, sonically this is a different 21 Savage than ever before, giving his most melodic performance to date, and a beautiful one at that. This song is one of the album's many highlights and an example of what 21 is capable of when he goes out of his comfort zone. He takes a similar R&amp;B route on a three-track run later in the album with the songs “see the real,” “prove it” and “should’ve worn a bonnet,” with the latter two featuring Summer Walker and Brent Faiyaz, respectively. These songs and others scattered throughout the album also see 21 in his melodic bag, a side of him that certainly needs to come out more often.</p>\n<p>Other gems include the handful of Metro-produced songs, and despite how great 21 has sounded on other types of instrumentals, this is his bread and butter, and 21 at his very best. In the modern rap landscape, it is hard to find someone better than 21 on a Metro beat. The chemistry between the two is just too strong, and when they work together they are able to create a sound that just cannot be replicated, no matter how hard someone may try. Examples on the album include the songs “nee-nah” with Travis Scott and “pop ur shit” with Young Thug.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite how far all of the artists have come in their careers and all their success, the Atlanta trap songs are the ones that made them who they are, and on these songs, it is very clear that they have not lost a step. The standout track on the album, however, is the song “letter to my brudda.” Over a relaxed sample-based beat and a piano melody, 21 goes for nearly three minutes straight, mostly discussing his longtime friend and collaborator Young Thug and his current situation. Thug and a collection of his labelmates are involved in an ongoing RICO case, alleging that Thug’s music label is in fact a violent gang. 21 provides his perspective on the situation, and what it is like to watch his friend have his freedom ripped away from him. He also touches on Gunna’s role in the situation, which involved the rapper, a former collaborator of both 21 and Young Thug, seemingly ratting on Thug and his labelmates for his own benefit, something 21 makes clear he disapproves of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the track, 21 lays all his thoughts and emotions out there, not holding a single thing back. In fact, being brutally honest and real is what attracts people to 21 and his music. He doesn’t sugarcoat anything, which may be gruesome at times, but at the end of the day, it allows him to paint a picture that not many others can replicate. So even though the style of his music may change a little bit, the sincerity of his music has never faltered, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to anytime soon.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

This Heirloom Market is the largest grocery store on Drexel’s campus, with the other grocery alternatives being the convenience stores Old Nelson, 7-Eleven, Wawa and Northside Dining Terrace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seven to ten people could be seen inside the store from the front windows, most wearing Heirloom Market clothing. A single security guard was standing within the entryway. Employees were also seen cleaning in the produce department, sweeping the floors and moving the coolers. In the checkout section, multiple registers were partially opened, and wooden mouse traps had been set and placed underneath the kiosks. Two to four people were in this area, and a large vacuum was present.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Department of Health order sign stated that the building had failed to comply with <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/philadelphia/latest/philadelphia_pa/0-0-0-272773#JD_Chapter6-300\"><u>Title 6, Chapter 300 of the Philadelphia Code</u></a>, which covers food safety. No further information was listed regarding the specifics of the violation.

            "body_html": "<p>The 81st annual Golden Globes was held in Beverly Hills, California on Jan. 7. The event, though down in TV viewership since last year, has taken the internet by storm. The host, comedian Jo Koy, has faced backlash after some insensitive jokes, especially ones made toward both Taylor Swift and the Barbie movie. With all the controversy, it was easy to miss the other, more positive things that occurred at the glamorous event. So, what else happened at the 2024 Golden Globes? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As members of the Philadelphia community, it is noteworthy that a Temple graduate won a Golden Globe. Da’Vine Joy Randolph, now 37, went to Temple University for her undergraduate program. She originally studied classical vocal music, with the dream of being an opera singer. After auditioning for an opera role in a Temple musical, she hired an acting coach to help her train. This caused a commotion at the school, ending with Randolph having to leave the program and pursue a degree in musical theater. Randolph graduated from Temple and went on to study at Yale and perform on Broadway before making it to Hollywood. Of late, she has been critically acclaimed for her work, finally securing a Golden Globe win for Best Supporting Actress in the 2023 film, \"The Holdovers.\"</p>\n<p>The night was full of first-time winners, including Lily Gladstone for Best Actress. Gladstone made history with her win, as she is the first Indigenous person to win an acting Golden Globe. She was born in Montana and had a desire to act from a young age. She performed all throughout her academic career, which culminated in a degree from the University of Montana. After college, Gladstone began to act in movies, with her first debut in 2012. By 2016, she was winning awards for her work, like the Best Supporting Actress award from the Boston Society of Film Critics. In 2023, Gladstone was the female lead in \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" Her performance in this role won her the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next two first-time winners came as a surprise to many Golden Globe viewers. After the theatrical event of the year “Barbenheimer,” it was expected that the stars of both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" would walk away with significant recognition. However, many were shocked to hear that Cillian Murphy won his first-ever Golden Globe for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. Murphy has also famously been featured in \"Peaky Blinders\" and \"28 Days Later.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After the success of \"Oppenheimer,\" another name circulating in film news was Christopher Nolan, the director of the film. Nolan and Murphy had worked together on six different films over the years, but it seems as though \"Oppenheimer\" was their first breakthrough at the Golden Globes. Christopher Nolan also took home his first Golden Globe for Best Director Motion Picture, which was a relief for him after four previous nominations for the award that did not result in wins. &nbsp;The other half of the “Barbenheimer” duo, <i>Barbie</i>, did not go home empty-handed either. The film won awards for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement and Best Original Song – Motion Picture for Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Oppenheimer\" was the ultimate winner of the night with five awards, but \"The Holdovers\"<i> </i>and \"Beef\" also earned themselves a few awards as well. While the event may have been surrounded by controversy over the host, that did not stop the stars from making history and celebrating their work together. The Golden Globes marks only the beginning of award season, as many are looking towards the Oscars. Currently, \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\" are predicted to continue their winning streak, and both Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Lily Gladstone’s names have also been thrown around. The Oscars will be live on March 10, when the celebrities will reunite, though with a different host this time. Will \"Oppenheimer\" prevail once again, or will another winner emerge? Only time will tell.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>What is the human race capable of when thrust into overwhelmingly adverse survival conditions? A prime display of such a situation came in the aftermath of a failed flight from Montevideo, Uruguay to Santiago, Chile in October 1972. The flight in question, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, carried 40 passengers, 19 of whom were members of the Old Christians Rugby Club, with the others consisting of the team’s friends and family. On Oct. 13, 1972, the flight met an unexpected and fatal end, as the aircraft collided violently with the Andes mountains. In the subsequent 72 days, those remaining after the crash braved the harsh, uncaring cold of the Andes in hopes of survival. Their story has been the subject of multiple film adaptations, first in 1976 with “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075290/\"><u>Survive!</u></a>,” followed more notably by “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/\"><u>Alive</u></a>” in 1993. However, Spanish film director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1291105/\"><u>J.A. Bayona</u></a> dares to present the most faithful representation of the historical tale put to screen in his latest survival thriller “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81268316\"><u>Society of the Snow</u></a>.”</p>\n<p>Released on Jan. 4 as a Netflix exclusive, “La Sociedad de la Nieve” draws abundant inspiration from Pablo Vierci’s 2008 <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/pablo-vierci/society-of-the-snow/9781408716373/\"><u>novel of the same name</u></a>, which heavily relies on firsthand accounts from the accident’s 16 remaining survivors. Thus, Bayona’s adaptation supplies itself with ample means to accurately convey the perilous experiences of the stranded passengers. Much of the film’s looming sense of grim, isolating chaos comes from its string of finely-tuned technical decisions. Case in point: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1939549/\">Pedro Luque's</a> cinematography excels in capturing the intended chilling tone and atmosphere. Luque’s work effectively thrusts audiences from Montevideo’s alluringly vibrant scenery to the Andes’ bleak stretches of snow, maximizing immersion in the protagonists’ tumultuous journey. Bayona’s decision to shoot most of the movie <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/shot-list-society-of-the-snow-netflix-ja-bayona-awards-insider\"><u>in the Sierra Nevada</u></a> instead of a typical film set further adds to the feeling of being dropped into an unwelcoming landscape with slim chances of survival. In addition, the makeup and costume design greatly aid in visually communicating the severity of the situation through the deterioration of the characters’ physical appearances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The simplicity of the storytelling on display in “Society of the Snow” is one of its most admirable features. Staying faithful to the events as told by the survivors, the film confidently takes little interest in manipulating the truth for heightened dramatic purposes, which seems common among similar Hollywood adaptations. This consistent commitment to authenticity results in a documentary-like style that does not concern itself with unnecessary theatrics or needless spectacle. That is not to say the film is devoid of its fair share of high-intensity moments, including the intentionally anxiety-inducing plane crash sequence near the start. These moments appear sparingly, however, and avoid exploitative sensationalism.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A similar degree of discipline is exercised in regard to the dialogue between characters and the portrayal of the characters themselves. For the most part, neither the writing nor the performances come across as overly cinematic, partly due to the palpable chemistry among the set of young actors. Consequently, viewers feel as though they are watching what would naturally unfold when a group of young friends are faced with the difficult decisions that arise throughout the film. Further, these challenges, including the debate over whether to resort to cannibalism for nourishment, are treated with a delicate maturity that invites the audience to arrive at their own conclusions regarding the moral dilemmas brought to light.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Unflinchingly miserable and dour at points, “Society of the Snow” ultimately prevails as an awe-inspiring retelling of the infamous Andes flight disaster. Bayona along with his talented cast and crew managed to mold this larger-than-life tale into an intimate experience that fully immerses viewers in both the tragedies and the beauties of the incident. In doing so, the film succeeds in either introducing or refamiliarizing modern audiences with the gripping story in a genuinely heartfelt, authentic manner.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Have you had a co-op? Are you currently working one or going through the application process? Drexel’s &nbsp;co-op program is one of the university’s main attractions, known for the advantages it offers to undergraduate students. However, after speaking with students around campus during the recent co-op cycle process for spring/summer 2024, many students expressed their concerns regarding the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second-year psychology student currently working at her first co-op claims, “Drexel advertises that we could make <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/academics/co-op/how-co-op-works\"><u>$20,000 </u></a>a co-op but as a psych major most of our options are either unpaid or offering a sum of money that is nowhere near what I expected.”</p>\n<p>Currently working 20 hours a week as an unpaid intern, she had to make the tough decision between experience and financial stability. The lack of paid positions, such as research positions, put students in difficult situations. Overlooking their financial situation is a privilege not every student has. Many students may give up an unpaid prestigious offer and accept a paid job because they cannot take the risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel should consider requiring their co-op employers to provide students with a stipend. The university needs to recognize that it is not feasible for the majority of students to receive no financial compensation whilst working for six months.</p>\n<p>Additionally, juggling multiple interviews during finals week is no easy feat. Especially for first-timers, the mixture of nerves and stress that come with preparing for interviews requires careful time management. Rushing from class to quickly change into proper business casual attire for your Zoom interview can leave you feeling both physically and mentally drained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the mandatory COOP 101 class students are required to take, many feel underprepared, learning to navigate the process as they go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third-year data science student shared her journey as she applied to co-ops for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I encountered many frustrations during the process, one of them being that you hear different types of information from different people. For example, when creating resumes COOP 101 has a different opinion on what should be on our resume compared to our co-op advisors. Then when you ask a student who has received a co-op already, they also have a difference of opinion on what should be included on our resumes. This makes the process pretty confusing as you don’t know what to include/not to include on your resume which also adds stress to whether you put the right things on it or not.”</p>\n<p>The student continued to express how she felt while balancing studying for her finals and getting last-minute projects/essays in on time at the same as giving interviews.</p>\n<p>“All of this adds a bit of pressure as you don’t know what to expect since there are so many different viewpoints on various parts of applying to co-ops.”</p>\n<p>Having recently undergone my first co-op cycle, my biggest advice to you all is to remain organized and strategically space out your interviews to avoid burnout.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to those who have already accepted an offer this co-op season and to those going into Round B, I wish you luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Safety is arguably the most important topic Drexel University students need to consider each quarter. With the bump in Philadelphia crime, including increased car thefts, violent robberies and even homicides, it is critical for students to take steps to ensure their own safety. I spoke with Dallas Drake, founder of the Center for Homicide Research, to discuss safety topics relevant to students at Drexel University. Drake is my former boss and an expert on homicide prevention as well as fire safety.</p>\n<p>Active shooters were the first topic we discussed. The Department of Homeland Security recommends a simple three-step approach to surviving an active shooter encounter – run, hide, fight. If you can run from the shooter that is the first thing you should do. The further away you are from them the more difficult it is for them to shoot you. Drake mentioned, “number one you should try to get away if there’s an active shooter. A lot of people want to see what’s happening when they hear a loud sound, don’t do that. Get the heck out of there!” If you are unable to run, you should hide until law enforcement arrives. For more information on how to act when law enforcement arrives you can read the <a href=\"https://https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf\">official Department of Homeland Security handbook on how to respond to active shooters.&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Finally, if neither of those options are available you should fight for your life. Active shooters often carry more than one weapon, so getting a firearm away from them does not necessarily mean you are safe. Drake mentioned success in past incidents where an active shooter was rushed by a group of people.</p>\n<p>Many people enter and exit through the same door every time they enter a building, which creates potential crowding around one door during a fire. There have been cases of people dying in fires simply because they didn’t know there was an exit behind them and were stuck trying to push their way through a crowd of people exiting through a single door. Drake mentioned an excellent point about smoke from fires stating, “In a fire, the exit signs are usually way up near the ceiling. The smoke rises and can cover the signs. It’s good to just know where the exits are instead of looking for the signs when an emergency is taking place.” Try to find out where all the exits are in a building and then go through them so you know where they will take you once outside. Drake went on to mention that people will follow their herd instinct and follow others in an emergency, even if it is the wrong way to go.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is involved in many crimes in one form or another. According to Drake, about 90% of all homicides involve alcohol use either by the victim, the offender, or both. Drake mentioned that alcohol reduces the ability of a victim to defend themselves or assess a dangerous situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drake commented on alcohol use and crime saying, “In most countries, the goal of alcohol use is more social than to become drunk. You don’t necessarily need to drink something with alcohol in it when you go out, but either way you don’t want to drink to the point that you lose control over yourself.”</p>\n<p>Don’t assume that offenders won’t be out in groups. Drake said of offenders traveling in groups, “Every time you have robbers or assaulters they seem to come in groups, often of at least three.” Drake had personal footage from his security system showing groups of three stealing from cars in his area. They have the upper hand in groups, but so can you. Drexel offers walking escorts 24/7, and there’s no shame in using an escort. Regardless of your size and strength, you likely won’t be able to take on a group of three attackers by yourself. <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/publicsafety/policing-security/escorts/\">To use a walking escort, simply call 215.895.2222 or use any of the blue-light emergency phones across campus</a>.</p>\n<p>The final topic Drake and I discussed was home safety. For starters, always lock your doors. This goes for your car door, house door and room door if you live in an apartment with roommates. Even if you have trustworthy roommates, you never know who they are bringing home with them. Locking your room door at night while you sleep is an added layer of security that will ensure intruders do not have easy access to you while you are asleep. Drake suggested using two locks on your front door, “It’s good to have two locks on the door in case someone breaks through a door window to unlock the door. Find ways to give yourself the upper hand. If you lived outdoors, you’d need to watch out for bears, elk, and wolves. There’s no expectation of safety anywhere, so the fact you need to be a little concerned in your house shouldn’t bother you.”</p>\n<p>Safety is a complex subject and there are many topics Drake and I didn’t get the chance to discuss. Crime is preventable, but you need to take steps to ensure your own safety. There are several great videos on YouTube talking about various safety topics. We strongly encourage you to look up topics related to safety in your free time.</p>",

Lots of people are entering 2024 anxious about what the future holds and, as a result, feeling helpless to do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe the state of the world has been snowballing downhill for the last half of a decade, or maybe it’s always been this way and we feel the turbulence more keenly now as we stumble into (or further into) adulthood. It’s most likely the latter, but in any case, it seems like with each glance at the news the world grows more weary, nervously anticipating the subject line of the next notification to light our screens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would not make the case that a state of turmoil, even at this level, is something unique to this decade, but I would wager that we feel the pressure more than our recent ancestors did, as we are now so deeply connected to each other in a way humanity has never experienced. It’s also true that too many of us are so consumed by the bad news of our own countries to think too much about that of the others. (Hopefully I’m not the first to remind you that it’s a presidential election year in the US…again? Already?)</p>\n<p>In the most difficult times, though, I think it’s important that we let things be only as bad as they are. It was Martin Luther King, Jr. who said that we should “accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope,” Mother Teresa who told us that our strength lies in the small things and Hank Green, perhaps the true voice of our generation, who told us that although no one person can change the world in any significant way, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ&amp;list=LLT1y18e5NgYwsVnATbQrArg&amp;index=27\"><u>“no one doesn’t change it at all</u></a><u>.</u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ&amp;list=LLT1y18e5NgYwsVnATbQrArg&amp;index=27\"><u>”</u></a> So, I implore you to find your own ways to make a dark world a little brighter.

He introduced Nanu’s to Drexel University with two of his three brothers: Ikram and Haroom. The Rashid brothers established their first cart in New York in 2003, as a surprise for their mother who was worried about their youngest brother, Adnan, due to his Down syndrome diagnosis. Five years later, the family moved to Philadelphia where they opened their first location at 2210 Cottman Ave during the summer of 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the grand opening on Drexel's campus, Nanu’s opened a truck on Temple’s campus two months earlier, so they now have three locations. Rashid explained that his dream is to expand beyond Philadelphia and even beyond Pennsylvania. He hinted at opening a new location in New York in the future.</p>\n<p>Students had been awaiting the arrival of this new food truck for many weeks and were overjoyed when they saw “free food” written across the banner of the truck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I was expecting to serve maybe 300-400 meals that day, ” Rashid said. However, over 700 meals were served on opening day with a line that barely fluctuated as more students arrived.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I slept well that night,” said Rashid.</p>\n<p>Some students told him that the spiciest chicken option, the reaper, was not hot enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Wow!” was all Rashid could reply. “I always get a medium because it's hot enough.” He plans to create a spicier option for those searching for more heat than just the reaper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although it is always good to have a delicious hot chicken truck just a block or two away from classes, Rashid emphasized that “Nanu’s is not just about the food but about family and friends coming together to think about those who are in need of help… and giving back to the community.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rashid explained that the truck was named after his youngest brother, Adnan: “We call him Nanu…that’s his nickname.”</p>\n<p>On behalf of his brothers, Rashid was positively overwhelmed with the turnout at Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I wanted to thank everyone who showed up.

Drexel’s &nbsp;co-op program is one of the university’s main attractions, known for the advantages it offers to undergraduate students. However, after speaking with students around campus during the recent co-op cycle process for spring/summer 2024, many students expressed their concerns regarding the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second-year psychology student currently working at her first co-op claims, “Drexel advertises that we could make <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/academics/co-op/how-co-op-works\"><u>$20,000 </u></a>a co-op but as a psych major most of our options are either unpaid or offering a sum of money that is nowhere near what I expected.”</p>\n<p>Currently working 20 hours a week as an unpaid intern, she had to make the tough decision between experience and financial stability. The lack of paid positions, such as research positions, put students in difficult situations. Overlooking their financial situation is a privilege not every student has. Many students may give up an unpaid prestigious offer and accept a paid job because they cannot take the risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel should consider requiring their co-op employers to provide students with a stipend. The university needs to recognize that it is not feasible for the majority of students to receive no financial compensation whilst working for six months.</p>\n<p>Additionally, juggling multiple interviews during finals week is no easy feat. Especially for first-timers, the mixture of nerves and stress that come with preparing for interviews requires careful time management. Rushing from class to quickly change into proper business casual attire for your Zoom interview can leave you feeling both physically and mentally drained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the mandatory COOP 101 class students are required to take, many feel underprepared, learning to navigate the process as they go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third-year data science student shared her journey as she applied to co-ops for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I encountered many frustrations during the process, one of them being that you hear different types of information from different people. For example, when creating resumes COOP 101 has a different opinion on what should be on our resume compared to our co-op advisors. Then when you ask a student who has received a co-op already, they also have a difference of opinion on what should be included on our resumes. This makes the process pretty confusing as you don’t know what to include/not to include on your resume which also adds stress to whether you put the right things on it or not.”</p>\n<p>The student continued to express how she felt while balancing studying for her finals and getting last-minute projects/essays in on time at the same as giving interviews.</p>\n<p>“All of this adds a bit of pressure as you don’t know what to expect since there are so many different viewpoints on various parts of applying to co-ops.”</p>\n<p>Having recently undergone my first co-op cycle, my biggest advice to you all is to remain organized and strategically space out your interviews to avoid burnout.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to those who have already accepted an offer this co-op season and to those going into Round B, I wish you luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.&nbsp;</p>",

It is one thing to engage in honest inquiry and robust debate about complex issues. It is another to traffic in hateful slogans and symbols that have nothing to do with inquiry or debate,” President Fry wrote.</p>\n<p>In addition, President Fry paid homage to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his email to the Drexel community: “In the meantime, as we begin this winter quarter, we must rededicate ourselves to the work of following Dr. King's blueprint for building a beloved community: Let's strive mindfully to learn, empathize, and grow together across our different backgrounds, perspectives, and viewpoints, and mine our diversity as a source of strength.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, CCI Dean Yi Deng sent a message to all faculty and students regarding the incident.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“CCI is a community that welcomes everyone and fosters inclusivity and mutual respect. This repugnant behavior is completely unacceptable and is categorically not within the fabric of our College, nor the University as a whole,” Yi Deng wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked to provide a University statement, Vice President of Strategic Communications Niki Gianakaris stated, “Drexel University is committed to ensuring a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment for all of our students, faculty and professional staff. The University does not tolerate acts of bias, discrimination and harassment. The University condemns discrimination in all its forms, including hate speech and threats of violence, and will continue working to fulfill its commitments to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further details of the investigation have not been revealed. At this time, it is unclear who wrote the message or what exactly was written.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Gianakaris, “The University community will be updated once the investigation concludes.”</p>\n<p>This incident follows reports of antisemitism in the previous Fall term, as reported on Oct. 20, 2023 by <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/arson-and-antisemitic-graffiti-heighten-fears-of-hate-crime-on-drexel-campus/\"><u>The Triangle</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The campus is grounds not only for sociability but also for developing a community, and that entails supporting the small businesses within it. While there are not shops set up around campus, students have gotten creative with establishing themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Freshman product design major and Philadelphia native Juliet Wang-Herrera uses her passion for design for her side-hustle as a nail artist.</p>\n<p>“The short version as to why that’s my passion is because I simply wanted to,” she joked. “My professional answer is that I just wanted to be a designer. Product design allows me to explore that in a more intensive way.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeing how in her free time she is constantly creating and exploring new mediums, Wang-Herrera has expanded that into creating nail extensions and press-ons for students who cannot have long nails but want the artistic appeal of acrylics. Her art style mainly consists of 3D work and bright colors that are reflected within her products.</p>\n<p>Wang-Herrera provides acrylic and gel services and sells press ons to those who may be more comfortable with them. She also does soak offs and nail repairs for her clients. A Westphal student, Wang-Herrera is able to use her tools as her paintbrushes and her clients’ nails as the canvas in order to create beautiful works of art. From nails displaying intricate designs that are reminiscent of celebrities such as Kali Uchis to others that show cute characters such as Kirby and Hello Kitty, she is not only showing her skills but helping her customers wear their personalities on their fingers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I welcome everyone to my desk but I’m really trying to reach people who love nails as much as I do and want to explore different textures and styles that they wouldn’t get at your typical nail salon,” said Wang-Herrera.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked what makes her shop different to others, she explained that she is willing to try new things with her clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Everyone showcases their creativity in different ways, ways that in some cases I have never thought of. I am willing to go that extra mile and make sure that my clients are happy. I will listen to your stories too. When you sit with me, I like to say you’re getting a two in one special: beautiful nails and someone to lend you an ear. That’s how my customers and I end up becoming good friends by the end of it.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Describing her brand in one word, Wang-Herrera said, “Layered. Just like people, I like to say that my work comes in layers both physically and metaphorically. On the surface level, my tools are there to help perform the task successfully but the way I look at it is that each buff I make, every coat of polish is a reflection of the person sitting at my table. There’s different formulas and different layers within my process to get to that end result. I am also someone with layers. It’s not just one version of me that I’m willing to show. I’m also willing to help others do the same.”</p>\n<p>Find her on Instagram (@nails.byjuliet) to schedule an appointment.

            "body_html": "<p>Safety is arguably the most important topic Drexel University students need to consider each quarter. With the bump in Philadelphia crime, including increased car thefts, violent robberies and even homicides, it is critical for students to take steps to ensure their own safety. I spoke with Dallas Drake, founder of the Center for Homicide Research, to discuss safety topics relevant to students at Drexel University. Drake is my former boss and an expert on homicide prevention as well as fire safety.</p>\n<p>Active shooters were the first topic we discussed. The Department of Homeland Security recommends a simple three-step approach to surviving an active shooter encounter – run, hide, fight. If you can run from the shooter that is the first thing you should do. The further away you are from them the more difficult it is for them to shoot you. Drake mentioned, “number one you should try to get away if there’s an active shooter. A lot of people want to see what’s happening when they hear a loud sound, don’t do that. Get the heck out of there!” If you are unable to run, you should hide until law enforcement arrives. For more information on how to act when law enforcement arrives you can read the official Department of Homeland Security handbook on how to respond to active shooters: <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf\"><u>https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf</u></a> Finally, if neither of those options are available you should fight for your life. Active shooters often carry more than one weapon, so getting a firearm away from them does not necessarily mean you are safe. Drake mentioned success in past incidents where an active shooter was rushed by a group of people.</p>\n<p>Many people enter and exit through the same door every time they enter a building, which creates potential crowding around one door during a fire. There have been cases of people dying in fires simply because they didn’t know there was an exit behind them and were stuck trying to push their way through a crowd of people exiting through a single door. Drake mentioned an excellent point about smoke from fires stating, “In a fire, the exit signs are usually way up near the ceiling. The smoke rises and can cover the signs. It’s good to just know where the exits are instead of looking for the signs when an emergency is taking place.” Try to find out where all the exits are in a building and then go through them so you know where they will take you once outside. Drake went on to mention that people will follow their herd instinct and follow others in an emergency, even if it is the wrong way to go.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is involved in many crimes in one form or another. According to Drake, about 90% of all homicides involve alcohol use either by the victim, the offender, or both. Drake mentioned that alcohol reduces the ability of a victim to defend themselves or assess a dangerous situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drake commented on alcohol use and crime saying, “In most countries, the goal of alcohol use is more social than to become drunk. You don’t necessarily need to drink something with alcohol in it when you go out, but either way you don’t want to drink to the point that you lose control over yourself.”</p>\n<p>Don’t assume that offenders won’t be out in groups. Drake said of offenders traveling in groups, “Every time you have robbers or assaulters they seem to come in groups, often of at least three.” Drake had personal footage from his security system showing groups of three stealing from cars in his area. They have the upper hand in groups, but so can you. Drexel offers walking escorts 24/7, and there’s no shame in using an escort. Regardless of your size and strength, you likely won’t be able to take on a group of three attackers by yourself. To use a walking escort, simply call 215.895.2222 or use any of the blue-light emergency phones across campus (https://drexel.edu/publicsafety/policing-security/escorts/).</p>\n<p>The final topic Drake and I discussed was home safety. For starters, always lock your doors. This goes for your car door, house door and room door if you live in an apartment with roommates. Even if you have trustworthy roommates, you never know who they are bringing home with them. Locking your room door at night while you sleep is an added layer of security that will ensure intruders do not have easy access to you while you are asleep. Drake suggested using two locks on your front door, “It’s good to have two locks on the door in case someone breaks through a door window to unlock the door. Find ways to give yourself the upper hand. If you lived outdoors, you’d need to watch out for bears, elk, and wolves. There’s no expectation of safety anywhere, so the fact you need to be a little concerned in your house shouldn’t bother you.”</p>\n<p>Safety is a complex subject and there are many topics Drake and I didn’t get the chance to discuss. Crime is preventable, but you need to take steps to ensure your own safety. There are several great videos on YouTube talking about various safety topics. We strongly encourage you to look up topics related to safety in your free time.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>There is no question that the university model is in crisis. Lingering financial stress due to the pandemic, unpopular tuition hikes and a dwindling pool of applicants have been putting the pressure on colleges and universities to adapt to the fact that many students are losing faith in the worth of a college degree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in response to the adversities, institution closures and mergers are becoming a trend, with the biggest impacts being seen in <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/how-many-colleges-and-universities-have-closed-since-2016/539379/\"><u>New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and California</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This trend is present here in Pennsylvania, too; we have seen a complete shutdown at Cabrini University, shocking students with the announcement that it would be closing its doors in 2024, while big universities are absorbing smaller ones, as our neighbors at the University of the Sciences join St. Joseph’s University and Salus University in Elkins Park prepares to merge with Drexel sometime next year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The exact value of a college degree is debatable in the modern age, but it is clearly still a favorable path for many young adults. Thus, the question remains — how prepared are university leaders for the major challenges of commanding an institution of higher learning and how can they keep their schools immune to the resulting damages?</p>\n<p>Drexel’s Pennoni Honors College’s Pennoni Panels are known for their open discussions regarding topics of concern in all sectors of modern discourse. Their ongoing interview show, \"Civil Discourse,\" recently had Honors College Dean Paula Morantz Cohen sit down with three college presidents for a discussion on the threats faced by the modern university. \"Civil Discourse,\" according to Cohen, aims to discuss “important, often controversial topics with candor and good will.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Future of the University Panel featured Nora Demleitner, president of St. John’s College in Annapolis, Maryland, Dr. Jonathan Holloway, president of Rutgers University in New Jersey and our own president, John Fry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A large problem that the presidents cited they face is popularity among their student bodies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you want to be loved, get a dog,” quipped Dr. Holloway. “No matter what type of university you helm, if a problem comes to your attention, it means that it hasn’t been solved by really smart people on at least two or three different attempts. So by the time it lands on your plate… …any decision I make, I’ll personalize it, [so] I’m automatically making somebody else unhappy. That will have a permanent effect on how your presidency is understood.”</p>\n<p>A large part of the issue with popularity and a major frustration among students everywhere is transparency, or a lack of it, between the student body and the administration. Students of The College of Saint Rose in New York, which announced its <a href=\"https://www.news10.com/news/saint-rose-students-protest-college-closure-demand-answers/\"><u>forthcoming closure</u></a> on Dec. 1 2023, are outraged at the sudden and unexpected news. Students now have less than a year to figure out what they are going to do next, with little to no previous warning from the college, whose board had been discussing the possibility of closure for some time before making the final decision Nov. 30 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked how to balance demands from pressure groups such as the student body and the board of trustees, President Fry said, “Every year has been my hardest year. I think what I’ve discovered is that the important thing is to keep a network within [and outside] the institution… …so you’re not backed up against the wall when a decision will be made, [which] is going to be unpopular one way or the other.”</p>\n<p>Fry continued to talk about his position in handling the student protests to Drexel’s involvement in the affordable housing crisis last year. Though it was not an easy discussion to have, Fry believes the dialogue between himself and the students was productive and respectful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All three presidents discussed at some point in the panel the value of making college accessible, citing the percentages of their student bodies that are Pell Eligible or First Generation. President Demleitner also praises St. John’s unique model as a reason why their institution stands out, with every class being held seminar-style. Fry spoke similarly of Drexel’s cooperative education model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dean Cohen and the presidents also discussed free speech, campus safety, mental health and the recent Supreme Court proceedings on Affirmative Action.</p>\n<p>“Presidents have to walk the fine line where we are lowering the temperature in terms of speech so that people can hear each other, while preserving campus safety,” said Dr. Holloway of free speech at Rutgers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding Affirmative Action, Fry said that though the institution must comply to the proceedings, it will not change its internal value set. This was echoed by the other panelists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We can’t turn our back on who we are, why we were founded, and who we are today… …we will continue to seek out the kind of rich diversity that characterizes our university,” Fry added.</p>\n<p>The problems faced by universities through their selectiveness and inclusivity are important discussions to have, but the biggest threat to the university model is the belief that it is becoming obsolete.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I do think we are living in a moment where people are reducing higher education to this transactional value,” said Dr. Holloway. “How much does it cost per class, or whatever metric you’re going to use to measure it… and that statistic is usually wrong …and that is higher ed’s fault for not telling the story accurately …and what am I going to get in return transactionally?”</p>\n<p>Dr. Holloway went on to say that, although it is true that colleges must prepare students for a career in their field of study, and the return on investment should be lucrative, college also serves as a time to teach “a heightened sense of social skills, like understanding an apparatus of how to operate in the world do that when they’re on the job market, they can thrive.”</p>\n<p>President Demleitner believes the university model survives and prevails because of “the power of curriculum,” which gives students the opportunity to engage in complex and deeply personal discourse founded on their unique backgrounds and identities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dean Cohen asked of President Fry his thoughts on the corporatization of the university model, to which Fry replied, given the number of professional employees and students, the University is bound to “use those investments from our students and families wisely, and to steer the university in the right direction, in the right way.” Fry continued, “[We have to] protect the dollars that we have so that we can invest them directly into academics… …if that’s corporatization, then I’m all for it.”</p>\n<p>“We organize ourselves around our own convenience, the convenience of our administration [and faculty], and the students are the ones that have to navigate this. Guilty as charged on the bureaucracy question,” joked Fry, “What we’re working on right now is, how do we simplify our systems so it is possible for students to really have a much more bespoke experience.”</p>\n<p>The panel wrapped up on the topic of rankings, such as the ones done by the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges\"><u>U.S. News &amp; World Report</u></a>, where Drexel has recently ascended into the top 100 universities list. Completely arbitrary and “troubling in every way,” &nbsp;though the rankings are, as stated by Dr. Holloway, the panelists agreed that although there are too many other factors at play, and the rankings made by these large news companies cannot be standardized to all students, it is still evidently important to incoming students and must be considered.</p>\n<p>With limited time to address an endless list of issues faced by modern universities, it was inevitable that the panel would only scratch the surface. It is clearly true that these presidents, and most college presidents, are intelligent, well-educated and well-equipped to manage their schools. But in the face of adversity, which model prevails? A large, publicly funded state university like Rutgers, a slightly smaller, private, research-focused university like Drexel, or a small liberal arts college focused on discourse and community like St. John’s?</p>\n<p>The current trends of university closures make it hard to tell right now, but it is undeniable that all of the panelists’ institutions have merit in their current operations and diverse student bodies. The question of which model will prevail, which will survive the current hardships and move on to face the next set of challenges, is one that must be left to time.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>PAX Unplugged is a tabletop gaming convention hosted at the Philadelphia Convention Center every December. The event features an overwhelming number of tabletop games including crowd favorites like Settlers of Catan and Munchkin. It's best to arrive as early as possible to get the most out of the day. PAX Unplugged offers both day passes and full weekend passes, but a single day pass is adequate for most casual tabletop fans as long as you arrive early. The convention starts at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, but the line to get in will wrap around the building before the doors even open. Expect to wait in line for at least an hour if you arrive any time before 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>Once inside the convention center, prepare for an overwhelming amount of things to see and do. The best way to approach an event like this is to pick a direction and start walking. This event is best experienced with a small group of friends, but plenty of people attend by themselves as well. You will be looking at a lot of board and card game items available for purchase. There were also several artists selling artwork at the convention.</p>\n<p>The long wait to get in means that most people won’t see much before lunchtime. Food and drink items are sparse and expensive inside the convention center. A souvenir cup vendor selling sodas and mugs was outrageously expensive at $50. This included a mug, lid and straw which were all sold separately. Some of the mug setups they were selling were even more expensive than that! It can be difficult to justify these prices, and with so many great restaurants in Chinatown, it does not make sense to purchase food or beverages inside the convention center. Be prepared to either pack a lunch or eat outside of the convention center.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to play three games while attending the event. The games were Squid Game: Let the Games Begin, Star Wars: Unlimited, and the Pokémon trading card game. Squid Game: Let the Games Begin was the clear favorite among the three games. The board game follows the events of the show perfectly and utilizes a timer to keep players on edge. Fans of the show will enjoy the opportunity to play variations of the games played by the show’s characters.This was a casual game that anyone could pick up and learn. The second game was a Star Wars themed trading card game coming out this year. Fans of Star Wars will enjoy seeing beloved characters in a trading card game, but the rules were confusing. A few slight tweaks to the game could make it one of the best card games out there, but it is likely too late to make those types of changes. The third game was a classic – the Pokémon trading card game. The play area was bright and colorful. The game was taught by a staff member who was patient and clearly enjoyed Pokémon. Many people collected Pokémon cards when they were young but not nearly as many people knew how to play the trading card game. At the end of the demo the staff gave out free cards so that players could play the game at home. The card game was fun and easy to learn. A free pin was also given out which made a great souvenir to remember the day.</p>\n<p>While the convention is designed for more hardcore tabletop gamers, it can still be an enjoyable space for more casual players. None of the people in my small group were hardcore gamers, and we occasionally made jokes about playing Uno at some point during the convention. The event even includes appearances by a handful of celebrities who signed autographs and answered questions during panels. If you have never been to PAX Unplugged, I enthusiastically recommend giving it a try at least once. In summary – pack a lunch, arrive early, wear comfortable walking shoes and play some games!</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>We have officially entered week two of the new term. The professors have finished housekeeping, the assignments are coming down on us, and all around, students are gearing up for battle. To keep from losing ourselves on the academic warfront, here's a rundown of the latest updates on campus news.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia's Moody Weather: What exactly is Mother Nature up to? Temperatures rose as high as 54 degrees Fahrenheit last week, and I think we all became too familiar with what summer on campus will be like on the third floor of the Main Building. In contrast, this week came with a blend of rain and flurries and snow and wind chills. And what has Drexel administration been doing in response to nature’s mood swings?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a three-day weekend came an uprooted sleep schedule, and the promise of over three inches of snow gave rise to both expectations and disappointments this week. Waking up at the crack of dawn to the sound of my brother’s high school voicemail announcing that classes were canceled was painful, especially since Drexel offered a delay on normal operations until…10 a.m.? We still had to attend some classes on Zoom, which was enough to transport us back through time into the groggy routine of COVID-ridden 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was exactly three steps outside and a slip of the foot later while on my way to my 6 p.m. orgo lecture when I started hoping Friday’s snow will do a better job on keeping us inside. I gather here all my hope for a commuter friendly week.</p>\n<p>Rise of the Nanu’s Hot Chicken Cult: I spent 40 minutes in a waiting line. The blaring sun blinded my eyes while I inched toward the bright orange truck that was, apparently, going to revolutionize campus food with its hot chicken. We were like sheep, flocking toward the warmth of crispy fries and tender meat. The blanket of creamy sauce was calling to us. Some canceled meetings. Some ditched classes. And some stayed in line for four hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My only question: Was the Nashville hot chicken worth the wait?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many disappointed students did not get to relish the deal. Some had enough of the wait and opted for the less busy food trucks that were teasingly close, and others, like me, decided it was finally time to attend their classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, I bring to you four descriptions to shed light on the taste of Nanu’s Hot Chicken, provided to me through the grapevine: “tender chicken cradled in a warm bed of soft buns,” “perfect mixture of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside” and “golden seasoned fries with a finesse.” Do with that what you must.</p>\n<p>Basement or Bane?: Gone is the comfort of a cushiony lounging area of study, the plushness of a well-used sofa. And enter an amalgam of off-putting orange and long legs and tiny rectangles. In all its glory, what exactly is the new layout of Hagerty Library’s basement?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will say that I hate to judge a book by its cover, so there will come an attempt on The Triangle's readers' behalf to complete assignments atop the deadly combination of uncomfortable stools and claustrophobic desktops in the future. As of right now, I’m steering clear of it all. I saw it once, and I don’t have to see it again.</p>",

This included wins over Hampton, UNC Wilmington, and William &amp; Mary, where the Dragons outscored their opponents by an average of 23.7 points, with their smallest margin of victory sitting at 15.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dragons were by no means playing poorly prior to the start of conference play in the CAA, as they notched big victories over #18 ranked Villanova, as well as Winthrop and UAlbany, who both sit atop their respective conferences. However, the Dragons’ out of conference play lacked consistent offensive rhythm, which led to key momentum-killing losses to Big 5 opponents La Salle and Temple, as well as WVU and Bryant. Since the start of the new year, however, the Dragons have played at a much higher level, and fixed a large number of their flaws in their game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most obvious improvement has been the 3-point shooting, as Zach Spiker’s team has taken a huge step forward from a 28.9% shooting rate in the old year to an incredible 48.1% rate since. The improvement in shooting has not come from only one player, either, as Justin Moore, Mate Okros and Luke House are all shooting above 50% from beyond the arc in at least a dozen attempts each, all making great improvements over their 2023 shooting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel has even made improvements on their greatest strength in the first half, their defense, which held opponents to an average of 63.6 points per contest. Since CAA play began, however, the Dragons have held opponents to an average of 61 points per game, and only allowed a remarkable 34.7% shooting from the field, and 24.7% shooting from deep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dragons suffered a loss prior to conference play, as senior guard Lamar Oden Jr. went down with a lower body injury, but multiple players have stepped up to lessen the blow of his loss. Former walk-on Luke House, who has emerged as one of the Dragons top talents over the past two seasons, has been fantastic in conference games, shooting 62.5% from the field, 53.8% from 3-point, and scoring 13 points per game. Aside from House, sophomore guards Justin Moore and Kobe Magee have shot the ball much better, and contributed to Drexel’s rise in scoring over their first three conference matches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As conference play continues, it will be interesting to see if the Dragons can remain consistent with their improvements, and if it can lead them to a CAA Regular Season or CAA Tournament Title.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>After the attack on Oct. 7, President John Fry — just a day after the conflict — sent out a school-wide email, addressing the tragic event and his stance on the situation. Starting off bold and strong, President Fry stated, “I join with all of you in mourning the loss of innocent life…” And so on the letter went, affirming once again his alliance with suffering Israeli people, even sending his condolences to those who were facing great losses at the Gaza border at the time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>President Fry’s letter on the surface seems to be a sympathetic one – one that addresses the loss of Drexel’s colleagues, one that lends a shoulder to suffering family members, and one that speaks of great empathy to all students on campus. Yet, ironically, many people find his letter to be a slap in the face, a stain on the names of struggling Palestinians, and a direct contradiction of his own words: “mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n<p>Failing to mention the decades-long history of Palestine oppression prior to the conflict, President Fry has stirred anger among students, especially Muslims and Palestinians on campus. His letter, by only spreading sympathy to the State of Israel who has been constantly oppressing Palestine for the past 56 years, acted as the stimulus for students across campus to stand up and voice their own opinions.</p>\n<p>Starting with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CyPLrBDKZj1/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa\"><u>@drexelsjp</u></a>’s (Drexel Student for Justice Palestine) open letter to President Fry, more and more student organizations began to advocate for the innocent lives of Palestinians by directly criticizing President Fry’s statement as well as host protests across University City. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CyghkAPAoYv/?img_index=1\"><u>Drexel’s Muslim Student Association</u></a> has also taken their stance on the issue, directly vocalizing their support for Palestine. The Rush Building – home to Drexel’s Student Center for Diversity &amp; Inclusion – also hosted an event showing solidarity for Palestine by hanging up their flags around the area, marking the organization’s firm opposition to the on-going genocide in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amidst the outrage in response to his letter, Fry went on to send out three more emails, emphasizing his concern for students and faculty. In the second statement (sent out Oct. 11), Fry provided students with mental health resources and mentioned vaguely of “a line between expressing strong opinions through robust discussion, debate, and peaceful protest — and targeting any individual for discrimination, intimidation, or hate.” Though the matter was not made clear in this email, it was directly mentioned in President Fry’s third email (sent out Oct. 14) where he referred to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/drexel-dorm-anti-semitism-vandalism/3666052/\"><u>hate crime</u></a> performed against a Jewish student in Race Resident Hall. And it was not until his fourth and final email (sent out Oct. 20) that President Fry extended his “full sympathy and support to our Palestinian students, faculty, and professional staff, whose pain and trauma deepen by the hour as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and casualties rise.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>President Fry's response has undoubtedly caused more stir within students and faculties. Enraged by President Fry’s subtly biased statements, Drexel SJP went on to lead <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw4tOrJ6Z4/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa\"><u>a student walkout </u></a>in front of the Dragon Statue – Drexel’s famous mascot. Efforts to protest against universities’ support for Israel have also been heightened with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CywxQzZLili/?ref=playak.com&amp;hl=pa&amp;img_index=1\"><u>national student walkouts </u></a>hosted by Drexel and UPenn. Student organizations, playing the role of courageous advocates, have strongly and firmly stated their voice within the community, further spreading awareness to other peers on campus. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>As for President Fry, it is difficult to say the same about him. From the very first statement, President Fry has infuriated many with his superficial and one-sided address regarding the conflict. It is careless, and extremely harmful, to mention the Oct.7 attack without referring to the five decades-long of constant torture and occupation of Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a historically-loose announcement, President Fry — intentionally or not — has opened the gate for many to wrongly perceive the situation, leading to conflicts intensified on both sides. The tense environment is portrayed so vividly on our own campus where Palestinians suffer the loss of representation, and at the same time, Jewish suffer the cause of hate crime invoked through peripheral historical understanding. Therefore, it is strongly and robustly the President’s job to be more cautious and careful with his own statements so that further cases of hate crime and student oppressions can be prevented.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it should not take a fire alarm ringing dreadingly at 1 a.m. or countless student walkouts for President Fry to understand his responsibilities as acting President of Drexel University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more context of the war, one can visit informative resources such as videos made by<a href=\"https://youtu.be/w5B9FBiFkQk?si=gShyNNIwnMwTb6dH\"><u> Johnny Harris</u></a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lv1SpwwJEW8?si=Pb_soLb5L-F2P41A\"><u>Vox</u></a> or educational material at <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/10/19/resources-palestinian-liberation/\"><u>PRISM</u></a>.

            "body_html": "<p>“From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free.”</p>\n<p>This chant was echoed in front of the Dragon statue at Drexel University on Nov. 17 by an estimated 50 people in an effort to raise awareness regarding the recent conflict between Israel and Palestine.</p>\n<p>A student solidarity walkout occurred on campus, consisting of participants from organizations such as Drexel Students for Justice in Palestine and Penn Students Against the Occupation of Palestine. Organizations partook in the Shut It Down movement created by grassroots organizations such as the National Students for Justice in Palestine and the Palestinian Youth Movement. Attendance consisted of a diverse array of students, professors, and faculty, standing shoulder to shoulder, coming together for one purpose, to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. The atmosphere was charged with emotion and a sense of urgency as unified voices chanting phrases such as “1, 2, 3, 4, Occupation No More,” reflecting the protesters' demand for a free Palestine. Signs and banners among the sea of people stood tall, with messages such as “Ceasefire Now,” and “Protect Academic Freedom” on posters as individuals rallied in solidarity.</p>\n<p>The rally was aimed to address and speak out against the growing issue of doxxing and intimidation of student organizers that has recently been occurring on college campuses across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students and faculty of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania gathered to express their concern for the ongoing increase of intimidation and doxxing tactics, such as blacklisting. The rally consisted of three speakers, including speakers from UPenn, a grad student at Drexel, and a Drexel Professor.</p>\n<p>A speaker from UPenn attempted to empower the crowd, and encourage a mindset of strength and unity. The speaker communicated this by saying, “... their intimidation only works if we are intimidated by it. There are decades of student organizers that have come before us and millions of student organizers that we stand with now, and we will continue speaking out as long as it’s going on.”</p>\n<p>“Doxxing is not a new tactic. Leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Junior were doxxed and experienced incredible government surveillance,” stated another speaker at the protest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The speaker continued to list college campuses in the U.S. where anti-Palestinian acts have taken place to silence student voices. On Nov. 10, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4304627-columbia-suspends-student-group-palestine-jewish-israel-hamas/\"><u>Columbia University</u></a> suspended the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) campus organizations for the entirety of their fall semester. This occurred after hundreds of Columbia students participated in a campus-wide walkout calling for a cease-fire, hosted by the two groups the day before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am scared for the safety of my friends and myself only because we are speaking out against the genocide,” claimed a speaker concerned about doxxing.</p>\n<p>“Shame!” the crowd responded.</p>\n<p>Following the last speaker, protesters marched in unison to City Hall to join a &nbsp;larger-scale pro-Palestinian protest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an interview with The Triangle, a third-year Palestinian-American student at Drexel, who asked to remain anonymous due to the potential risk of facing consequences, expressed their concerns about being Muslim and Palestinian on campus recently.</p>\n<p>“I am scared, and frightened while being on campus as a visible Muslim. Being able to be identified in a crowd, or even walking alone is terrifying, just having to think that I will be the next victim, the next person to be attacked, judged, and mistreated for being who I am. Knowing that I am a visible Muslim puts not only me but also my career at risk. Knowing that some companies won’t hire me for what I believe in is unjust and unfair and knowing that I cannot change that makes me feel helpless, and also makes me lose motivation in trying to achieve all the goals that I have set for myself.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they felt about the intimidation tactics that are being used on students who voice their opinions, they responded,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am only in the design industry, so I stand by my work, and I stand for who I am. However, I do have anxiety about where my career is going to head not knowing if certain companies will accept me, not knowing if I’ll even make it being a designer because of who I am even though I am standing for what is right. But those who have to work for larger companies like working in the Medical field, are at a super high risk. I’ve spoken to at least three people who had to disassociate from who they are just so they can continue their studies. I know someone personally who’s in their third year of residency and hasn’t been able to speak up about what’s going on in Palestine, although he was born and raised there, in fear of being fired because someone they know already has been.”</p>\n<p>College campuses should be safe spaces for students of all races, ethnicities, and religions to voice their opinions. Students have a right to use their voices without the fear of being reprimanded or silenced for their beliefs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/news/drexel-community-comes-together-in-vigil-for-palestine/\"><u>Vigil for Palestine</u></a> that was hosted by the<a href=\"https://dragonlink.drexel.edu/organization/mena\"><u> Middle Eastern and North African</u></a> (MENA) club on Nov. 9, a student claimed, “I attended the vigil with my friends, and in the middle of a speech this other student walked up to us, pulled out his phone to record us, and then proceeded to leave.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Capturing and filming individuals is a known doxxing and intimidation tactic that is being used on pro-Palestinian students. By exposing their identities and political affiliations, it can be used as a weapon against students to threaten them, potentially compromising their academic and professional aspirations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is the duty of colleges to protect their student's privacy and eliminate any prejudices that may harm a student. Drexel’s co-op interview selection process is the reason for many students' silence on sensitive issues. Students fear that there may be biases towards certain applicants due to their political beliefs. This fear must be eradicated. Drexel must foster an inclusive and unbiased environment that allows students to openly discuss their stance on issues without fear of repercussions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As members of the new generation, college students have a right and responsibility to speak on events that will shape their futures. Therefore, it is imperative that they use their voices, advocate for their beliefs, and never remain silent.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>College, branded as a time for education but also self-discovery and freedom, can become damaging without the proper tools for success. A poll taken by the <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/education/509231/college-students-experience-high-levels-worry-stress.aspx\"><u>Gallup and the Lumina Foundation</u></a> in March 2023 reported that out of 2,400 college students, 66% were experiencing stress and 51% reported “feelings of worry during a lot of the day.” Additionally, they also found that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/472247/emotional-stress-students-covid.aspx\"><u>emotional stress was reported to be one of the main reasons students considered dropping out in the fall 2022 semester.</u></a> A niche community of college students, who are very involved with the music, film and arts aspects of education is at great risk of experiencing mental health issues as well. <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>A recent survey</u></a> of 1500 independent musicians found that “73% have symptoms of mental health illness.” The individual needs of diverse communities like artists and musicians require solutions customized to their interests and individual needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Emily “Noa” Silverman, a Junior in Graphic Design and graphic designer for the Drexel Theater Company, spoke about how though she herself has employed good practices of stress relief such as drawing in her personal time, many of her friends in Fashion Design have felt academic pressure due to the fast pace of Drexel with little support from educators. Noa later spoke about how this affects the community on campus, mentioning how “we also don’t really have a community-based culture here, it’s all very work-oriented.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Speaking with a second-year fashion design student, who chose to remain anonymous, it was evident that artistic mediums like making music and drawing were significant stress relievers for her. She emphasized the importance of expressing her creativity amongst the rigorous nature of her major, especially considering the extremely fast-paced nature of the Drexel quarter system. “For things not involving my degree, [the arts] are an outlet of expressionism for which I have no limitations. When feeling overwhelmed, it’s nice to have something to put your thoughts out to see for yourself.” She is not alone in this sentiment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/power-of-music-in-mental-well-being\"><u>In a research review</u></a>, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) detailed the surprising implications that music exposure had on human well-being. Specifically, an analysis of music therapy showed it to have an “overall beneficial effect on stress-related outcomes” and be a useful tool to address serious mental health concerns and substance abuse issues. It is also important to consider other forms of arts, film, and entertainment categories that may be useful tools for addressing mental health issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stevie Vagio, a freshman film and television major, is very involved with the arts and entertainment scene at Drexel. Taking lots of film classes and doing hands-on projects in the field, Vagio provided interesting insights into the unique mental health struggle experienced by people in his major/field. “Once in a while, I do feel burnt out due to the creativity demanded of my major” he says, bringing up an intriguing point. Whereas a biology or engineering major may feel mental health challenges in the form of stress or anxiety over their workload, a film and television major struggles in a different way: creatively. Creative burnout, <a href=\"https://www.idsa.org/wp-content/uploads/Creative%20Burnout%20-%20Suffocating%20The%20Future%20Of%20Design.pdf\"><u>as described by the Industrial Design Society of America</u></a>, can loosely be defined as the loss of the ability to creatively generate or express ideas, things that are certainly a focal point of any individual pursuing a degree or career in the arts or entertainment industry. Creative burnout is “a major inhibitor for creative individuals that is often overlooked or dismissed” and should certainly be considered in the context of a college education. Vagio had a notable solution to creative burnout and other mental health issues of arts and entertainment involving students. “Having opportunities to submit films conveying their own mental health problems” could provide a unique outlet for students involved in film to relieve their stress and address their mental health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Micheal Messina, junior film and television major, member of the Drexel Entrepreneurial Game Studio, and Producer, also mentions the stress that can come with doing projects in such a collaborative program. He notes “A lot of people are willing to work with you if you reach out to them, but I think that [educators] could do a better job at helping people who are not as comfortable reaching out to professors and students in general by maybe adding us all to a portal or somewhere where we can speak to each other that way.” Messina also mentioned the cultivation of student projects and how those greatly can affect one's feelings about themselves and the program, as these projects allow for personal expression and creativity in a way that assignments might not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cat LeFebvre, a freshman undecided design major, also had interesting insights into the issues and interventions applicable to students in her field. Whereas Vagio was more focused on the film and media aspects of arts and entertainment, LeFebvre discussed thefine arts aspect of the field. While LeFebvre agreed with Vagio about the risk of creative burnout, she also emphasized the importance of finding an art medium as a stress outlet that was “soothing, had reduced pressure and emphasized more of the work and less of the stress.” She described her personal experiences doing physical things with her hands to assist her mental health, some examples of such tasks being sketching and drawing on her notes. While she did mention art clubs and other student organizations that put on art therapy events such as drawing nights and t-shirt making, LeFebvre stressed the need for more Drexel-sponsored events (that are not club events) to support mental health, especially during final exams. “Little things like jazz nights and drawing nights can be something to consider. They don’t have to be big; they just have to be effective.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The points made by LeFebvre brought up another aspect of arts and entertainment mental health interventions that can be overlooked: the accessibility of the programs. Freshman Graphic Design major, Sarah Bonsall, has had her own mental health struggles but had some interesting perspectives on potential university-wide interventions for them. “It would be cool to have university-wide events or things in the dorm that are easily accessible.” She went on to describe the Westphal and graphic design schools as putting a large emphasis on mental health without ensuring that the resources are easily accessible. “Professors can send students emails with steps that we can take to improve our mental health. Even an information session during Welcome Week [with mental health resources and techniques for Westphal and design majors] would be helpful.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Acknowledging the important role that stress, burnout, exhaustion and other forms of mental health issues have on human wellbeing, the Central Federal Association of the Public Health Insurance Funds in Germany allocates funds to &nbsp;Creative Arts Therapies (CATs). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836011/\"><u>A scientific review published in 2018</u></a> describes CATs as being an intervention that “encompass[es] art, music, dance/movement, and drama therapy as their four major modalities” to approach individuals creatively and nonverbally. Notably, CATs differ from traditional forms of therapy by constantly encouraging clients to create/generate. This unique approach to utilizing the creative arts to address mental health challenges is definitely applicable in the context of the Drexel system.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/76449/How%20Art%20Therapy%20Can%20Assist%20College%20Students%20from%20Diverse%20Backgrounds%20in%20Overcoming%20Cultural%20Differences.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>University of Wisconsin</u></a>, the Student Health and Counseling Services adopted the practice of art therapy to support the wellbeing of the students in attendance. Their studies found that art therapy was incredibly beneficial to students, especially those who were undergoing culture shock from being in a different country or those who could not express themselves as freely. Many found that CAT was a successful relief, as it allowed a new medium to express emotions. Having scheduled events throughout the term, especially during times when students are experiencing high levels of stress (such as midterms and finals) may prove to be especially beneficial, especially to students who generally strive to employ the use of art, film, media and beyond as therapy. &nbsp;</p>",

More snow and ice followed on Tuesday, Jan. 16, and Friday, Jan. 19, which <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/weather/philadelphia-snow-totals-weather-forecast-winter-storm-20240119.html\"><u>the Philadelphia Inquirer</u></a> described as the closest thing we have had to \"an old-fashioned\" snowfall in two years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://6abc.com/weather-philadelphia-snow-drought-how-much-pa/14326149/#:~:text=January%2029%2C%202022%2C%20was%20the,the%20longest%20streak%20on%20record\"><u>ABC News</u></a>, this snowfall broke a 715-day drought with over 1 inch of snow, with the last time the city had over 1 inch of snow being on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>Drexel University's operations felt the effects of this sudden snowfall. After the first powdering of snow on the evening of Jan. 15, Drexel released a university-wide email on Jan. 16 saying that due to the weather, all on-campus operations would be delayed until 10 a.m.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel again suspended certain services due to the larger snowfall on Friday, Jan. 19, such as the Drexel bus services, which did not resume until Sunday, Jan. 21.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several students expressed their delight at having snow after nearly two years of only a few snowflakes here and there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third year student Brandon Leibowitz reported that it \"has been annoying\" that Philadelphia doesn't get snow very often, so this rare occurrence of snow \"was great\" and \"very exciting.\"</p>\n<p>Many students had similar sentiments; fourth year student Yair Oppenheim feels snow \"slows everything down,\" and gives us an opportunity to \"pause\" and \"live a little more,\" appreciating what usually gets lost in the hectic day-to-day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>International students also had positive reactions to the snow. Second year student Eden Sutton, expressed that she thinks that \"there's something magical about snow,\" especially for international students who come from \"very warm, desert-y places.\"</p>\n<p>Another second year international student, Nassar Otmani, felt that the snow brings \"a feeling of calm and tranquility,\" which gives people a moment to slow down.</p>\n<p>Otmani also said it is great to see communities \"come together\" to enjoy winter activities, like student snowball fights and snowman building.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even though many students enjoyed the snow, it also presented some challenges, particularly regarding mobility and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sutton described some disappointment with how Philadelphia handled the snow and felt they did not do \"the best of jobs\" in clearing its streets of ice or putting down salt before the snowfall.</p>\n<p>\"As a foreigner, no one really tells you how to deal with it yourself,\" Sutton expressed. She continued to explain that while the snow looked pretty one day, \"you find yourself walking on ice and probably getting hurt the next.\"</p>\n<p>The regular challenges of acclimating to different climates and all that comes with snow were only heightened by the ice sheet covering campus on Jan. 16.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second year student Yael Passy, described that she loves snow, and being from the south, she doesn't get to see it so often, making it an exciting, \"very fun\" opportunity; she also noted the difficulties that come with it.</p>\n<p>Passy felt that after the roads and sidewalks got icy following the first snow: \"No one was lifting up the ice, so it was a little dangerous on campus.\"</p>\n<p>She further described how \"Drexel did a great job for the second snow,\" but that the university seemed \"a little unprepared\" for the first snowfall and that campus \"felt a little dangerous\" the first few days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other students had similar experiences; for example, third year student Gavi Spellman was happy about the snow and said that it was \"nice\" to see the snow \"for the first time in a couple of years on campus.\"</p>\n<p>However, Spellman also felt that it was \"kind of icy out\" and that there wasn't enough salting at the beginning, which made the roads and sidewalks slippery.</p>\n<p>Spellman described that he felt that Drexel corrected it later on and put more salt out, which made the campus \"a little safer, which was nice,\" but that it was \"a little bit difficult at first,\" citing that he even \"slipped a couple of times.\"</p>\n<p>Along with the general disappointment with how Drexel handled the snow in terms of clearing the streets and sidewalks, some students expressed disappointment at how some Drexel departments dealt with absences due to the snow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The snow and icy sidewalks made it difficult for some students, especially commuters, to make it to class.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First year commuter student Pha Punsuk, was unable to make it to classes due to the snow but, per Drexel's policy, was not granted an excused absence, which she was \"disappointed\" about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The snow itself, combined with Drexel suspending buses on the days it snowed, made it much more difficult for commuters to make it to classes. Those who braved the cold and perilous icy sidewalks often fell on their way to classes, with reports of such incidents commonplace on Tuesday and Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, even with the icy-cold conditions, students still enjoyed the snow. From snowball fights to making snow cream, building snowmen, or even sledding down the hill by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Drexel students still found ways to make the most of this increasingly rare opportunity.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Triangle sat together with Michael Rankin, the director of Drexel’s Strength and Conditioning, and talked about what the program is about, his long time being at Drexel, and his experience working with an NFL team.</p>\n<p><b>Raphael Bartell: You are the Director of the Strength and Conditioning program here at Drexel. What does your daily work at Drexel look like?</b></p>\n<p>Michael Rankin: My direct work has changed over the years. When I started here it was only me and the GA (graduate assistant). I was in the gym pretty much all of the time. I used to see all of the athletes here. As I’ve been here longer we had a larger staff. Right now we have 6 people here including myself. Overall I would say that there is a lot of scheduling involved in what I do. There is a lot of management from the programming making sure that everything that we can squeeze in is squeezed in. I think if we are prepared for the athletes we can give them a better product and more attention. The more attention we can give our athletes the more they can realize what is the right way to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: You have been here at Drexel since 2002. What has changed over the 22 years you have been here?&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>MR: The weight room, as it is right now, didn’t exist when I started here. We had a much smaller area for our athletes. When we were able to build a new gym area we got more space for our athletes. One of the biggest additions was having a place to warm up. To be able to assess how people are feeling and moving is a really important part of our work here. We also made the changes to a free weight based program which we have now. Before that we used to train with machines. I think that we have all the resources now to be able to move forward. I don't think there is anything that we can’t meet whatever level student athletes come in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: What are some key elements a Division 1 athlete needs in order to to get the most out of their athletic practice?</b></p>\n<p>MR: For me there are really four key elements. First, I want to make sure that we touch on something mindset wise. I think you have to be really strong with how you're thinking when coming into the gym. A phrase people here always hear me say is: “Is what you're thinking helping you or hurting you?” Because challenges will always be a part of your life, whether it will be in the weight room, on the field, on the court, in your work, in the classroom or in your social life.</p>\n<p>The second would be fueling. We are really lucky to have a sports dietician in Andrea Irvine on our staff to be able to fill in with questions like: “Hey, what's the best type of fuel to put in so I can perform.” If you are fueled properly then you should be able to perform in all aspects of your daily life. And having so many options to choose from in the city or on campus can be overwhelming. But having some kind of guidelines can be really helpful for our athletes. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>The third key aspect is movement, being able to assess how you are moving. Is it moving well and how can you basically progress that and make it feel better, stronger, and faster.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fourth one is recovery. The most important aspect of recovery is sleep. Everything in between seven and nine hours is ideal. But you should still listen to your body and look at what you are needing and how you are feeling, so you can make adjustments. A lot of the other things get rolled in like doing ice baths, and fueling your body correctly, especially hydration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: A lot of pro athletes praise that lifting would prevent them from suffering injuries, would you agree?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I don’t think that we can prevent injuries. I think we can reduce the occurrence with good overall training. It comes down to the four key elements we have talked about before. &nbsp;So if I’m at a really bad place up top I don’t think that I can really go forward. If I’m not fueling properly, if I’m not recovering properly and if I’m not moving properly, well, these can all contribute to a higher occurrence of injuries. It is all connected. How often do people get hurt and they didn’t sleep well for a couple of days, or they were highly stressed for a few days which threw them all off. Those things all come together and I think we need to have a program that puts us in the right place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>RB: In 2013 you had an internship for the NFL team, Cleveland Browns. How was this experience and what did you bring back to Drexel from this opportunity?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I loved it! I was very fortunate to be able to go out and work with a sport that I don’t get to work with here but played (Western Maryland College). It was like being around superheroes. When the helmet went on I can remember just feeling this overwhelming feeling of happiness, because it just seemed to be so cool to me. The camp was a big realization for my work here at Drexel. Wow, I get to work with almost like comic book heroes every day. Because the number of people who have the abilities that Division 1 student athletes have is actually very rare. It doesn’t seem that way but the overall population can’t do the things that the kids here on this campus and across the country can do. They are not only students but they have to do study hall or homework, practices, meetings, strength and conditioning, and they have their social life. There is a lot on their plate. It’s pretty special and I don’t know if we realize that as often as we probably should. It’s a pinch me moment when you realize that you kind of have some superpowers. But man it’s so cool to be able to come in here!</p>\n<p><b>RB: Fitness is currently one of the most hyped trends on the internet. On social media you can see countless influencers that are defined and have huge muscles. Is this something that concerns you?</b></p>\n<p>MR: I don’t get too concerned with things that I can’t really control. And social media is not something that I can control. Gaining an immense amount of muscles takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It’s not easy and it doesn’t happen overnight. I don’t want to broadly say don’t look at things online, because I think that there is some valuable information out there. But you have to be able to filter out what is useful and what isn’t. And I think you have to be careful too with understanding that not everything you see on social media is real. It is just made for that to entertain you. It’s not real life.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><b>RB: Would you say that there is a way to gain a lot of muscles in a short period of time?</b></p>\n<p>MR: In a short period of time typically raises caution flags for me. Strength and muscle gains come in small increments. You have to try to get one percent better each day. And if you do that consistently I think that you can do amazing things. But it really takes a long time. I think it can be done but you have to put in the right amount of fuel, the right amount of recovery and the right amount of work. And you gotta do that for a long time, knowing that it is small gains. If you see somebody get huge overnight, ask questions.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Part of being a student is struggling with the escalating costs of education. Whether it is tuition or textbooks, the financial burden might sometimes feel overwhelming. However, one expense that seems to be overlooked, yet often hurts our pockets, is the mandatory purchase of homework software and apps.</p>\n<p>In recent years, it has become increasingly common for various departments and classes at Drexel to make it compulsory for students to purchase specific homework software platforms such as Pearson, Zybooks, WileyPLUS, and Cengage. While these tools are marketed as essential for improving the learning experience, offering interactive assignments and immediate feedback, their high costs — often about $100 per subscription or more - add yet another expense to our already tight finances.</p>\n<p>What's especially concerning is the lack of clarity about who is making these decisions. Are these mandates coming from individual professors or the department? Students are frequently left in the dark as to why a particular software or app is considered important or mandatory for their course. Is it truly improving our learning experience, or is it merely an attempt for the department to increase revenue?</p>\n<p>Here are just a few examples from students around campus of amounts they have paid for mandatory homework software and the corresponding classes:</p>\n<p>Cengage: $133.27 for ECON 201</p>\n<p>McGraw Hill: $120 for BUSN 101</p>\n<p>WileyPLUS: $140.69 for PHYS 152-154</p>\n<p>Pearson: $118.79 for ENVS 260, $91.80 for MATH 101, $140 for PHYS 101, $113 for MATH 171, $132.49 for PHYS 101</p>\n<p>Zybooks: $64 for ENGR 131, $81.62 for CS 171, $56.71 for CS 172</p>\n<p>AKTIV Learning: $25-$45 for CHEM 101 and 102</p>\n<p>Lab Investigations Manual: $84 for PHEV -146</p>\n<p>These examples show the significant financial burden imposed on students by mandatory homework software purchases across various majors and departments.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the question of accessibility cannot be ignored. Not all students can afford these costly software licenses, leading to inequality in resource availability. As a result, several students in the past had no choice but to drop classes causing major setbacks to their plan of study and academic journey. This contradicts the values of equity and inclusion that Drexel strives to uphold.</p>\n<p>As the bills pile up, it is becoming evident that the existing approach is not working in the best interest of students. I believe it is time for an open and valuable discussion about the decisions driving the mandatory software purchases. It is also crucial that both departments and professors should explore alternative options and be transparent about their reasoning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the end, I do wonder who are these homework software benefitting- is it the students, faculty or university publisher tie-ups?</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Hitting theatres on Dec. 22, 2023, “Anyone But You,” is a new romantic comedy that has taken social media by storm. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The film’s plot is based on William Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” and throughout the film, there are nods to famous lines and plot points from the play. It all starts when Bea (Sydney Sweeney) — a carefree, quirky, but struggling law student — instantly hits it off with powerful, sarcastic-but-vulnerable finance clerk Ben (Glen Powell). After a brief falling out, the two reconnect months later during the wedding of Bea’s sister, Halle (Hadley Robinson) and Ben’s best friend, Claudia (Alexandra Shipp). Bea and Ben spend most of the duration of the movie pretending to be together to both ensure the happiness of the wedding party and to create envy in their respective exes, Jonathan (Darren Barnet), and Margaret (Charlee Fraser), who surprisingly show up in Australia for the ceremony. Of course, there are several obstacles in the couple’s way, which make faking a relationship difficult, but in the end, the two fall for each other in a not-so-fake way. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the film played very well in the rom-com genre. While there were certainly a few scenes trending toward the more passionate/intimate end, what made the movie enjoyable was the heavy amount of comedic relief offered. Some of the classic movies thought of in this genre focus too heavily on the relationship between leading characters and not so much on the light-hearted entertainment that makes viewers smile and laugh. “Anyone But You” was an incredible example of how humor could turn what would otherwise be “cheesy,” “corny” or “predictable” (terms heard all too often when speaking of similar movies) into a satisfying tale that celebrates love. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aside from including this wonderful balance, “Anyone But You” displayed wonderfully made costumes and beautiful scenery. Because it was filmed in Sydney, Australia, watchers get gorgeous views of crystal blue waters, breathtaking mountains and even a few encounters with the unique creatures that can be found down under. The costumes added to the magic, as designers made wonderful (and realistic) choices that perfectly matched each character’s personality. Sweeney in particular can often be envied for the glamorous dresses and fashionable everyday wear she sports throughout the movie. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, “Anyone But You” showcased a talented cast and offered a refreshing new take on the rom-com. Chemistry and comedy combine to make this film a truly special adaptation of the Shakespeare original that makes the notion of finding love all the more believable.&nbsp;</p>",

Its location makes it a prime spot for students to stop by on their way to the center of campus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Opening up on Drexel’s campus has been an experiment since we’ve mainly been functioning in mall locations up until this point,” said District Manager Angel Khanna. “This is one of the first street-side locations and it has been really successful so far. We’re looking forward to potentially expanding to other college campuses sometime in the future.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auntie Anne’s/Cinnabon/Carvel focuses on stellar customer service, cleanliness in the workspace and having fresh and quality products for everyone to enjoy, according to Khanna.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The [Auntie Anne’s/Cinnabon/Carvel] has more of a variety of options on the menu, and it’s a good addition to the rest of the locations on campus because of the quality of the food,” said Shaniya Gohel, a student that currently lives on campus. \"I find myself going in between classes often because of how close it is.”</p>\n<p>“Every time I go in, there’s always a lot of people,” said Basil Roy, a student who currently commutes to campus. “When I first came to the United States two years ago, Auntie Anne’s was the first place I stopped to get a snack from so it’s really cool that it’s spreading to more types of locations. There are definitely a lot of good places to eat on campus, but not a lot where you can buy sweet snacks at a reasonable price.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve been up and running for about a month, training new employees as we pick up the pace, and everything has been running pretty smoothly,” said Khanna. “We hope to continue to help expand the campus food and snack scene for the rest of the term and years to come.”</p>\n<p>Hours of operation are 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In their past two games, Drexel’s Women’s Basketball team had two golden opportunities to make some noise in conference play and force themselves into the championship contender conversation as they took on the reigning CAA champions in Monmouth and the current first-place team in Stony Brook. But the Dragons fell flat in both games, sliding down the standings and making evident the glaring weaknesses that exist on this roster.</p>\n<p>In their first game, in which they hosted Monmouth in The DAC, the Dragons had a 4-1 conference record. While they had not taken on a top-ranked team yet, there seemed to be some momentum behind Amy Mallon’s squad and there was some hope that the team could keep rolling against the then 2-2 Hawks, the same team that unceremoniously knocked Drexel out of the CAA tournament last year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The game was largely a back-and-forth contest, and Drexel entered the fourth quarter down just two points. However, the Dragons ended up giving the game away to the Hawks in the final minutes to lose by a score of 63 to 55, and the dominant factor of the game was Monmouth’s ability to score the basketball while Drexel’s season-long offensive malaise continued.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Amy Mallon got a massive contribution from Amaris Baker, who erupted for 21 points, the rest of her squad was either ineffective, underutilized, or invisible. Brooke Mullins and Chloe Hodges each scored nine points on a combined 7-27 shooting performance. Freshman Laine McGurk was a bright spot as she contributed eight points on 3-7 shooting, but was only on the court for fourteen minutes. Grace O’Neil played all but four minutes in this contest, but only shot the ball one time and finished the game with no points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Drexel took a trip up to Stony Brook to take on the first-place Seawolves, there was some hope that Amy Mallon and her staff would be able to scheme a way to stifle their opponent’s offense. The Seawolves score an average of 76 points per game, a whopping 20 points more than Drexel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In good news, The Dragons held Stony Brook to just 62 points. In bad news, the Drexel offense went from ugly to ice cold. In the first quarter, the Dragons held Stony Brook to just 14 points, which would have been a great sign had Drexel not scored zero points in the opening ten minutes of the game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the first quarter on, the game was essentially over. Drexel shot 24% from the floor, 15% from beyond the arc, and gave up 15 points off of turnovers. Brooke Mullins shot a brutal 1-15 from the floor and Laine McGurk was unable to infuse any meaningful offense into the Dragons as she shot 3-10.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, these two losses are emblematic of Drexel’s greater issue, and that is their lack of scoring threats. Brooke Mullins is the team’s most skilled player, and while she certainly puts up shots, many of them are heavily contested and ill-advised. The reason opposing defenses can guard her so closely is because there are few other players on the team besides McGurk who can create their own shot and be an offensive threat.</p>\n<p>If Amy Mallon continues to not be able to find ways to create a more evenly distributed scoring effort from her team, the Dragons look like they will continue along as they have been, beating up on the bottom tier teams of the CAA and getting beaten up by the top squads in the conference.&nbsp;</p>",

This was the second matchup between the two sides as earlier in the month, the Dragons narrowly scrapped out a 67-63 victory in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>The Dragons controlled the game in every aspect. Besides an early three-pointer from the Aggies, Drexel maintained a lead for most of the game and never let the Aggies within arm's reach of them. One of the key factors of their success is their exceptional ability to rebound the ball. They won the rebounding battle 47-34, including 13 offensive boards that led to 11 second chance points. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“You can’t win a championship, you can’t win a ring without rebounds. We need to be a good rebounding team,” said Drexel head coach Zach Spiker. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forward Lucas Monroe had eight rebounds while Lamar Oden Jr. had nine as he returned to the squad from injury. Monroe also had seven points as he certainly established himself within Drexel’s starting lineup. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another key part of Drexel’s success is the depth of their bench. The Dragon’s bench combined for 34 points whilst the Aggies' only managed 8. Redshirt freshman Shane Blakeney made an immediate impact off the bench and scored a career-high 12 points. He scored three three-pointers and a layup that also got called for a foul. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other members like Jamie Bergens and Yame Butler can successfully fill in for the starters when they need a rest, whilst junior forward Garfield Turner can take over in Amari William’s absence. Turner had nine rebounds with four of them being offensive. Turner also had two of Drexel’s six blocks. Bergens and Butler combined for 12 points off the bench. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a lot of guys which means you’ve got a lot of combinations, and we got to continue to make sure we got the right people out there that complement each other. We still need to continue to make sure we’re putting the right guys in the right situations,” said Spiker regarding his bench’s depth. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s rotation of players can keep players fresh and eliminates the need for their starters to play 30-plus minutes every game like other collegiate programs. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It’s nice when you get subbed out and they bring someone in and there’s no drop-off. We have the CAA Preseason Player of the Year (Amari Williams) and we even sub him out. Everyone trusts each other when they’re on the court. It’s awesome, it takes a lot of stress off,” said Monroe. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spiker also credits the team’s success to their team’s bond on and off the court as well as Lucas Monroe’s impact in the locker room. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a fun group, we got a group that creates a lot of smiles and that’s awesome, but maybe time and place we need to be locked in. I think our guys respect him because Lucas puts the work in, and I think when you do that it’s easy for guys to respect you,” said Spiker. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heading into the back half of the season Drexel has been in talks of multiple March Madness brackets as the 13th or 14th seed. They are currently leading the CAA conference and are favorites to win it. Drexel has a two-win cushion over both 6-2 Charleston and UNCW but needs to finish strong and clinch the #1 seed of the CAA conference tournament. They head to New Jersey to face off against Monmouth University.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>As the volume of commitments increases and the May 15 signing deadline crawls closer, Drexel men’s basketball team has signed a player who could make a big impact in the near future. Clemson Edomwonyin is a big 6’10” forward from East London, England, who has a unique basketball background, making him a fascinating prospect to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edomwonyin has a rather unorthodox story of how he elevated to basketball excellence, as he first started playing basketball in the fall of 2020. He began his career at the City of London Academy, gaining initial attention for his incredible speed and athleticism as a forward. Edomwonyin follows a trend of Drexel recruits with British backgrounds, as both big man Amari Williams and sharp shooter Mate Okros played high school basketball in England.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In the UK, there’s a lot of underrated players that go undiscovered,” Clemson mentioned, “there are some unexpected people with big talent, and you kind of just go, damn this guy is good.”</p>\n<p>Although Drexel was his first Division 1 offer, it was not his only, as A-10 school Fordham also extended an offer to Edomwonyin. When I talked with Clemson, he made it clear the reason why he chose to be a Dragon in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The coaching staff was the primary reason,” he asserted. “Speaking with Spiker and all the other coaches gave me a lot of confidence.” Clemson added that his coaches in the U.K. were in full support of his decision, and admired Drexel’s track record of developing big men.</p>\n<p>On top of the coaching staff, Edomwonyin gave credit to Amari Williams, a fellow British forward, for helping assure him of his decision. “I was able to speak with Amari on my visit, and we got along well. He talked about how he used to play, and how the coaches helped him develop,” Clemson recounted. “It helped me picture the vision of playing at Drexel.”</p>\n<p>Following his time in London, Edomwonyin transferred to the South Kent School in Connecticut, an incredibly well established prep basketball program that has produced over 100 NCAA division 1 basketball players and 10 NBA players, including former NBA all-star Isaiah Thomas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adding to his impressive resume of high caliber basketball and rapid development, Clemson played with the U18 Spanish National team, where he followed in both Williams' and Okros' path playing at the Hoopsfix showcase. Clemson showed appreciation for what playing in Spain had done for his growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Early on I recognized I had to improve to compete with the tough competition,” Clemson stated. “I feel like [playing in Spain] gave me a lot of confidence in what I can do, and will help me translate my speed and athleticism to playing at Drexel.”</p>\n<p>It’s clear Clemson Edomwonyin is an incredibly talented basketball player with a lot of passion for the game, as well as a passion for the fans. When asked about what he was looking forward to about playing in Philadelphia he talked about the people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard the people in Philly are good fans, and I want to win for them.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, the talk of Philadelphia may have brought up the recruit’s appetite, as he expressed his excitement for trying Philly Cheesesteaks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clemson Edomwonyin joins Archbishop Wood’s Josh Reed as Drexel’s incoming freshmen for the 2024-25 season. Edomwonyin’s size paired with his athleticism could make him a big contributor, and his passion and personality should make him a fan favorite for the Dragons.&nbsp;</p>",

The partnership signifies both a financial boost for SEPTA and an increasing trend of institutional collaborations with public transit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Situated along SEPTA’s Market-Frankford line, the 30th Street subway station holds a pivotal role, <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/septa-30th-street-station-new-name-drexel-renovations/\"><u>described</u></a> as “a gateway to both Center City and University City.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The station also serves as an access point for trolley routes and bus services, making it a central hub in Philadelphia’s extensive public transportation network.</p>\n<p>The station has been undergoing renovations since 2020. Key improvements include the installation of a new head house, better elevators for enhanced accessibility, improved lighting and the implementation of advanced safety features. With these changes, SEPTA hopes to elevate the overall commuter experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paired with the neighboring Drexel Square, Drexel Station at 30th Street is set to welcome commuters to Schuylkill Yards. This district is a collaborative venture between Drexel University and Brandywine Realty Trust, embodying a 3.5 billion dollar investment that began with the opening of Drexel Square in 2019.</p>\n<p>Drexel University President John Fry <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2023/December/SEPTA-and-Drexel-Announce-Station-Naming-Rights-Agreement\">stated</a>, “We’re so proud to partner with SEPTA to put Drexel University's name on the station that serves as the gateway for so many of our students, faculty, professional staff, and community partners as they arrive on campus. As new educational, research, and business development opportunities continue to grow in West Philadelphia - it is fitting for Drexel to welcome everyone to University City.”</p>\n<p>The new and improved station is expected to be officially unveiled with a ribbon-cutting ceremony this year.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>As we reach February, we are one step closer to Spring. However, while it might take a few more months for the weather to warm up, Drexel’s winter sports season has already heated up as Tennis, Squash, Wrestling and Basketball are all entering the thick of their respective seasons. While you may not have been following each sport closely, The Triangle is here to get you up to speed with what's been happening on the various courts.</p>\n<p><b>Women’s Squash:</b></p>\n<p>Currently ranked 10th in the nation with a record of four wins and five losses, the Women’s Squash team has not been able to exactly replicate their success from the 2022-2023 season where they finished ranked fifth in the nation. The Dragons’ season featured four dominating wins this season, with their best win coming against the current 12th ranked team in the nation in Columbia University, and five losses, all against top-ten ranked teams. Even in the losses, however, the Dragons were in tight games, with three of their losses being decided by a score of five to four. On Feb. 9, Drexel will head to the Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference Championships to try and take home some hardware before heading back for more regular season play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Men’s Squash:</b></p>\n<p>Similar to the Women, the Men’s Squash team is experiencing a dip in the national rankings this season as they are presently ranked eighth in the nation after finishing last season at number five. Also similar to the Women, the Men have more or less taken care of business against teams ranked lower than them, while suffering defeats to teams ranked above them. The Dragons will look to earn some signature wins at the Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference Championships next week.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Women’s Tennis:</b></p>\n<p>While they have only officially participated in two matches, the Drexel Women’s Tennis team is off to a hot start as they have won matchups against Lehigh and Rider by scores of 7-0 and 6-1 respectively. Additionally, Drexel’s number one player Lorie Lemongo, a Junior from Yaounde, Cameroon, was named CAA player of the week on Jan. 30. The Dragons will look to keep up their momentum as they meet Mt. Saint Mary’s and Delaware State on Feb. 2 and 4, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Men’s Tennis:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>In their first two team matches of the season, the Dragons are a dominant 2-0. Across their victories over Villanova and Mt. Saint Mary’s, Drexel has dropped just one single match. While the team’s success has been a complete effort, the Dragons are led by Alan Jesudason, the team’s number one singles player, and his doubles partner Alex De Sousa. Together, De Sousa and Jesudason were named the CAA Doubles Team of the Week. Drexel will look to stay undefeated as they head up to Long Island and take on the Hofstra Pride on Feb. 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Wrestling:</b></p>\n<p>In a season that is shaping up to be one to forget, Drexel Wrestling is currently 2-8 in all matches and 1-3 in conference play. &nbsp;While their victories have been hard to come by for the Dragons, they were able to take down Princeton for their first EIWA win of the year. After being one of the six Dragons to win a bout against Princeton, Sophomore Jordan Soriano captured a win over the nation’s 28th-ranked wrestler, Jason Miranda, in Drexel’s loss to 20th-ranked Stanford.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The Drexel Dragons welcomed the Delaware Fighting Blue Hens to a packed Daskalakis Athletic Center of 2,461 attendees. A fierce CAA rival and the full capacity stadium during homecoming weekend were sure to create a buzzing crowd atmosphere. The Dragons had defeated Monmouth 78-74 a few days before and hoped to continue their dominant form in CAA conference play.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was the first game that the DAC sold out since they played Temple in mid-November of last year. That game was Drexel’s debut in the Philadelphia Big 5 as well as their home opener.</p>\n<p>Drexel came out of the gates strong, with a 12-4 lead in the first four minutes of the game. Justin Moore had an assist and five minutes in the opening two minutes, while Amari Williams had two assists and a block that was met by cheers from the Drexel fans.</p>\n<p>However, Delaware wouldn’t let the Dragons establish a lead. The Blue Hens regrouped during the TV timeout and clawed their way back to take a three-point lead midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the half went back and forth between the two sides. Luke House’s turnaround jumper reestablished a six point Drexel lead. House had four points in the first half.</p>\n<p>But a second chance putback from Delaware would level the scores as the halftime buzzer sounded. Drexel and Delaware walked into their locker rooms tied at 34-34 and nothing to separate the two. The Dragons led by five with three and a half minutes remaining but missed their final five shots and allowed Delaware to come back.</p>\n<p>The second half was all Drexel as they established a lead that Delaware wasn’t able to come back from. Mate Okros’ two three pointers got the DAC roaring in cheers and a Lucas Monroe jump shot gave the Dragons an eight point lead that forced a Delaware timeout.</p>\n<p>With less than three minutes remaining, Justin Moore found an open lane, drove in, and slammed a two-handed dunk that ignited another cheer from the crowd. With ten seconds left and the victory surely in Drexel’s hands, Lucas Monroe flew in from the point and slammed a dunk of his own to ice the game, running back to the Drexel student section with outstretched arms, blowing kisses to the crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t going to dunk it, but the lane opened and I saw the basket and I knew the crowd would love it so I just did it,” said Lucas Monroe on his dunk late in the game.</p>\n<p>Monroe played a well-rounded game, scoring a career-high 14 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. He also shot an efficient 7-9 from the field.</p>\n<p>“I feel more comfortable on the court now just from playing more, but I’ve never been a big-time scorer. I’ve scored 14 points before, never been able to get past it, but I can bring a lot of other things like rebounding and defending,” said Monroe, reflecting on his performance.</p>\n<p>Triple zeros ended the match where the Dragons finished with a 19 point lead over the Blue Hens. Drexel scored 52 points in the second half whilst Delaware could only muster up 33.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to have many fans at the game. Everyone’s really hyped, but we have a 1-0 mindset. So we were 1-0 today, tomorrow we’re 0-0,” said Monroe.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely exciting. The student section, fans, was a sold-out game, just think we’re even here right now. We were enjoying it while it lasts right now, but we know as soon as Monday hits we get back to practice it’s the only mindset,” said Amari Williams.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s dominance in the second half can be seen through the stat sheets. They shot 70.4% on 19-27 shooting and 60% from three on 6-10 shooting. Along with this Drexel had five players that scored double-digit points: Lucas Monroe, 14 points; Mate Okros, 12 points; Amari Williams, 14 points; Justin Moore, 18 points; and Kobe Magee;, 15 points. Together they scored 85% of Drexel’s points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’re just figuring it out. Knowing our roles, it takes the pressure off each other,” said Amari Williams.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the things about the team, is there’s times when some of the starters were sitting on the bench and I think that’s the beauty of this team. It’s nice to know when you know you have guys that are going to come in and there’s not going to be any dropoff,” added Monroe.</p>\n<p>The Dragons started the season 7-6 from their out-of-conference matchups, but since the Delaware game, Drexel is 5-0 from CAA conference play and sits comfortably atop the standings.</p>\n<p>“I think there’s a lot of belief and confidence in our locker room in each other and certainly from our staff to our players. You look at how we play now to how we played then, certainly, we’ve improved offensively and taking care of the basketball. The guys to their credit I thought they handled all that really well,” said Coach Spiker on the season so far.</p>\n<p>With the back half of the season to play and the upcoming CAA conference tournament on the horizon. Drexel has the potential to earn a bid into the NCAA tournament. As the leaders of the CAA conference, they hold their destiny as the season progresses forward.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Drexel University consists of people from different towns, states and countries. Some people carry their culture on their shoulders and are unafraid to show that to the world. One way the Black community does so is by wearing their hair in braids, locs, cornrows and other intricate hairstyles that have been passed down for generations. Getting these styles done in a clean and efficient manner come with high costs and require preparing for mental challenges of individual braider’s “rules.” Plus, there is no guarantee you will find someone in close proximity. So what are Black Dragons meant to do? They can seek the help of Dilys Attram, the owner of Hair by Dilly.</p>\n<p>Attram is a first year communication student with a concentration in public relations, and a first-generation Ghanaian-American who was born and raised in the Poconos. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I had a point in my life where I thought I wanted to do political science but I don’t think that that was for me,\" Attram said. \"When I got here, I didn’t have a focus and I was leaning towards journalism but when I looked into public relations, I loved seeing people interact and I thought that was so cool. The meaning that people have when they talk? It’s so interesting. With PR, you have to figure out how to problem solve, how to see into the future. With PR, you have to learn how to effectively translate what people want<i> </i>to say.”</p>\n<p>The goal of figuring out what the audience is asking of her can also be reflected within her work. Attram does not want to leave clients feeling insecure about their hair. Not only is expression through hair such an important aspect of black culture, growing up as a black person means that your crown says a lot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If I can have a say, I want to make you feel good about yourself especially when you see your hair,” said Attram.</p>\n<p>Delving more into her services, Attram is more of a braider than a stylist. She does loc retwists, knotless braids, traditional box braids, french curls, two-strand twists, rope twists and is slowly making her way into doing cornrows and stitch braids. She is a very flexible braider, and as she is young, Attram understands how new styles pop up often. When she is not experienced with certain types, she will offer a discounted price and friendly disclaimer in order to make sure her clients are aware and comfortable with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Attram had originally started braiding during Covid-19 when salons were closed and she was forced to have a more hands-on approach to hair maintenance. She was always the type of person to try and fix loose braids so trying it out on her own from scratch was not as daunting to her as it would be for others. From doing her own hair, to practicing on her mother, friends and roommates, whom she gives all her credit and love to for supporting her through this journey, she eventually established herself and created a small side hustle while still understanding her clients' need for affordable pricing.</p>\n<p>When asked to describe her business, Attram says it is constantly evolving. Every step she has made has been a learning moment for herself both in the braiding world and in the PR world. With the direct contact she has with her target market, she is able to understand what the people are looking for and how to give it to them.</p>\n<p>To contact Attram, you can find her on Instagram @hair.by.dilly.</p>\n<p><i>This article is part of a column dedicated to supporting small businesses on Drexel University’s campus.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Drexel Muslim Students Association held a closed door town hall with senior university leadership on Jan. 25 to share the experiences of Palestinian and Muslim students on campus since the humanitarian crisis in Palestine began. The town hall took place from 5-7 p.m. in Stratton 113, with a Zoom option for those who could not attend in person.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s senior university leadership consisted of five panelists that sat at the front of the lecture hall. There were around 30 students in attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We are here for peace. We are here to understand,” stated Noor Jemy, DMSA’s faculty advisor.</p>\n<p>The panel consisted of Vice President of Public Safety Mel Singleton, Vice Provost for Diversity, Equality &amp; Inclusion Leslie Ashburn---Nardo, Associate Vice President of Student Health &amp; Wellness Dr. Annette Molyneux, Executive Director of Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging Shardé Johnson and Associate Vice President and Dean of Student Life Dr. Katie &nbsp;Zamulinsky. Drexel’s Senior Vice President Subir Sahu was also in attendance. Each of the panelists explained how their department’s services were there to support every student at Drexel.</p>\n<p>Many students recounted their experiences of feeling unsafe on Drexel’s campus in regards to the university’s lack of support for Palestinian and Muslim students. They expressed how their mental health has been negatively affected. Participants described how they live in fear and how some of them are afraid to show their religious association or heritage in public due to the risk of being targeted. Students also reported that they received calls from their parents and loved ones cautioning them not to attend events in support of Palestine, as they feared they would be harmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’ll speak up no matter what. I’ll keep on putting on my hijab everyday,” stated a freshman biomedical engineering major.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other students expressed how they still choose to wear their keffiyeh as a symbol of their Palestinian pride.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In reference to wearing a keffiyeh, a former Drexel student stated, “Don’t ever let that courage go away.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also spoke about their disappointment in the responses of Drexel professors and common sentiments about inappropriate comments that dismiss feelings of distress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The social chair of DMSA and third year biology major at Drexel stated that one of her professors told her, “I don’t believe that this is a genocide,” after asking what the DMSA town hall was about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A freshman biomedical engineering student added that one of her professors told her that she was, “Too ambitious to be whatever you want to be for who you are,” in reference to the fact that she is Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple students brought up emails from Drexel President John Fry that they felt were misrepresentative and biased towards Muslims and Palestinians. The treasurer of DMSA compared emails sent regarding the events of Oct. 7 to those regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that there was a lack of resources provided to students and a lack of acknowledgement of the deaths in Palestine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also expressed dismay with how Drexel Police handled security for the Palestine Teach-In hosted by Drexel Palestine Coalition in Gerri C. Lebow Hall on Jan. 25 from 12 p.m. onward. A sophomore middle education student asked Chief of Police Singleton, why public safety, Drexel Police and the Philadelphia Police surrounded the building both before and during the teach-in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students stated that the high police presence made it feel like “public safety was protecting the university from them [teach-in participants].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his response, Singleton indicated that Drexel Police were not provided with information regarding how many people would attend the teach-in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He stated that Drexel Police’s main priority was to “protect everyone.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the meeting, Singleton repeatedly stressed his request for students to communicate more with campus police in order to build trust and familiarity with their presence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel Palestine Coalition released a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C2nGt2gOwuZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"><u>statement</u></a> regarding the police presence at the teach-in on Jan. 27 identifying the police presence as “an act of police intimidation.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The statement continued, “We condemn the police response as a disproportionate action which inherently criminalizes Palestinian identity and Palestinian liberation. We will not permit the criminalization of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim identities on or off our campus.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The town hall wrapped around 7:25 p.m. with DMSA stating that they planned to extend the availability of the panelists for more questions in the future. Sahu and the panelists confirmed that conversations about the safety of Muslim and Palestinian students have been happening within Drexel admin and will increase following the meeting to address the student feedback given. A link was given for attendees to provide additional feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on DMSA, visit their page on <a href=\"https://drexel.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/drexel-muslim-students-association\"><u>DragonLink</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>From Jan. 21 to Feb. 3, almost 120 restaurants participating in <a href=\"https://www.centercityphila.org/explore-center-city/ccd-restaurant-week\">Philadelphia Restaurant Week</a> are offering either a three-course meal priced at $45 per person or a two-course lunch for $20, with select locations offering three courses for $60. <a href=\"https://centercityphila.org/\">Center City District</a>, the organization responsible for Restaurant Week, shared some history behind this long-honored Philadelphia tradition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restaurant Week started in the fall of 2003 when an employee of <a href=\"https://www.smithandwollensky.com\">Smith and Wollensky</a>, a steakhouse in Philadelphia that has since closed, discovered Restaurant Week in a different city and partnered with CCD to bring it here. It has been recurring and growing every year since, celebrating its 20th anniversary this past November.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We started with… just over 30 restaurants, and now, today, we have 118 in the program, with… the most we ever had in the 130s,” Giavana Suraci, the senior manager of retail marketing and events at CCD reports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a restaurant week lover herself, she recommends <a href=\"https://themorrisphilly.com\">The Morris</a>, a newly established neighborhood steakhouse, which she credits for having excellent vegetarian options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sara Chiaravalloti, Drexel University alumna and current team member of CCD, shared her experience with Restaurant Week during her time as an undergraduate: “It gives you an experience with friends, especially people that you go to class with. I remember usually doing it with the women in business at Lebow. There were a group of great girls that I met from [Restaurant Week], and we did it practically every fall.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chiaravalloti especially recommends these deals to students who are new to the area and are looking to meet people, explore Philadelphia cuisine and support local businesses, all at an affordable cost. Chiaravalloti suggests <a href=\"https://giuseppesons.com\">Giuseppi &amp; Sons</a> (Italian cuisine), <a href=\"https://www.forsythiaphilly.com\">Forsythia</a> (French cuisine) and <a href=\"https://www.misssaigonphilly.com\">Miss Saigon </a>(Vietnamese influenced cuisine).</p>\n<p>Cailey Ruderman, class of 2024 majoring in materials science and engineering, is a Restaurant Week frequenter and expressed, “Restaurant Week in Philadelphia is a great opportunity for me as a college student to access the high-end food scene in the city without breaking the bank. I’ve visited a number of different restaurants throughout the city over the years and I’m excited to try more!”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruderman also mentioned that these three-course, fixed-menu options give her the rare opportunity to enjoy dessert with her meal.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Allie Lenz, class of 2025, operations and supply chain management, recently enjoyed her first Restaurant Week experience this year: “It was such a great deal… It was $45… and I was with one other person. We ended up just splitting everything.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.ristorantelanonna.com\">La Nonna’s</a>, the staff lets guests share their three courses, allowing them to cut costs on the already reduced $45 per person fee, providing a favorable opportunity for students on a strict budget.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [Restaurant Week] comes up so fast, and then I don’t realize it’s happening. I love the Philly food scene, so I most definitely [would return] if I could remember when it was about to happen,” Lenz confessed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brianna Heidenreich, class of 2023 majoring in environmental science, added a unique perspective as a new Drexel graduate who stayed local to Philly after commencement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It gives us a reason to catch up [with friends] and see how everything is going post-grad. It allows me to keep in touch with people who stayed in the area,” Heidenreich articulated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restaurant Week can provide an opportunity to set aside time for connections over an inexpensive meal at typically unaffordable places.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel students can benefit from Restaurant Week regardless of their participation in the actual dining experience. Continued support of the CCD and its programs, such as <a href=\"https://centercityphila.org/explore-center-city/ccd-sips\">SIPS</a>, park maintenance and the homeless outreach program <a href=\"https://centercityphila.org/foundation/our-work/outreach\">Ambassadors of Hope</a>, helps to promote safety and unity within the Philadelphia community.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In light of recent events, Liz Magill and Claudine Gay’s “alleged<i>”</i> ousting — or as they call them, “resignations” from their presidential roles at the University of Pennsylvania (Magill) and Harvard University (Gay) — it’s become apparent that aside from crypto and coding, knowing how to impeach a university president is an increasingly vital skill. After all, you never know when this information will come in handy. Though this seems comedic now, this article will prove its credibility when either party inevitably sues me for “slander,” “defamation” or any other grandiose yet ambiguous charge that has fairly little consequence: much like the actual role of any university president.</p>\n<p>Before you spend any more time reading this article, I advise you to rethink attempting a <s>coup</s>. Never mind, my editor said I can’t say that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attempt Two: attempting a “top-down restructuring of an educational institution” is not advised if you do not maintain the following prerequisites. These include but are not limited to: university faculty status – preferably a Ph.D. (or at the very least working in upper administration), general credibility amongst colleagues, reasonable cause (real or manufactured) and about one year to a decade of plotting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Typically overthrowing a university figurehead – sorry, “president” – involves (1) establishing cause. As listed under “prerequisites” you must have a reasonable cause for undermining your university administration. Though evidence does not have to be truthful, one must be able to prove it as though it is credible. This ties into (2) rallying the Troops. Once you have collected enough evidence you must sway your colleagues (preferably in upper administration) to your side. This portion is essentially workplace gossip designed to warrant mistrust of the president. Once you have sufficiently spilled the tea to the faculty, you must gauge how much support you have. This next step is what will make or break a coup. (3) At least two-thirds (this varies by the university) of the faculty senate must declare “no confidence” in the university president. Then the events will go as follows: the media will take wind of this story, your friends on the board of trustees will be talking, and then these same trustees will inevitably ask for the president's resignation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But honestly, all these steps feel like a lot of work so I will propose some easier ways to get rid of a university president. The easiest and most sane way to oust a president would be to do what they used to do to United States presidents back in the day – beware of convertibles if you catch my drift. If you’re an engineer might I suggest Elon Musking them into the sun? Though based on the fact Millennium Hall is sinking I would not suggest anyone here attempt this. Of course, I have saved the best for last, though this might land me on a watch list but hear me out: You could kidnap their firstborn child – [My editor said I can’t say this]. Hopefully, this helps inform your forthcoming plans as an agent of change, educational reformist, or future top-down--restructurer.</p>\n<p>With peace and love,</p>\n<p>Your Favorite Future Coup Leader ;)&nbsp;</p>",

You probably don't, but I’m going to tell you anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We seem to have a playlist for everything. When people are sad, they listen to their R&amp;B list, which ranges from \"Playing Games\" by Summer Walker to \"Sad, Beautiful, Tragic\" by Taylor Swift; &nbsp;it really depends on if you got left on read or dumped (which are kind of the same thing to those of us who live on Snapchat and haven’t been in an actual relationship). And of course &nbsp;there is the “I’m better” playlist which is filled with songs by The Weeknd and SZA. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When people are mad and want to scream, they listen to some rap and do twenty reps of god knows what in the gym… they think it’s their “gym era.” It’s not (They don’t go back until New Year’s, which only lasts for a week). And if they actually do stick with the gym grind, it starts off with songs from Drake’s newest album that they forced themselves to listen to, until they secretly go back to their 2010 throwback list. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When people are happy…well, I don’t even know…what do you do, pull out YouTube and type in “When you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands?” Yeah, you may be able to tell I’m a bit snippy right now… I’m currently listening to \"Never Lose Me\" by Flo Milli; I’m in my bad bleep/academic weapon era. Never mind the fact that my \"sad girl\" and \"I’m better\" &nbsp;playlists had been on repeat for the past two weeks… don’t ask me whether I got left on read or dumped. They’re basically the same thing ;)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you mad at my brutal honesty? Go play \"Niagara Falls\" by Metroboomin, Travis Scott and 21 Savage, then skip to 31 seconds. It’s a rap song, there’s a lot you can learn from me. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>College kids, man, so predictable.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In the peculiar town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, the annual Groundhog Day extravaganza is upon us. While the rest of the world grapples with serious matters, Punxsutawney's focus is squarely on Phil, the rotund rodent with an uncanny knack for weather predictions.</p>\n<p>As the sun rises over this quirky town, Phil emerges from his burrow to face the daunting task of forecasting the next six weeks of weather. The town holds its breath, creating a palpable atmosphere of anticipation — well, except for that one guy who seems more confused than a squirrel at a traffic intersection.</p>\n<p>Phil, the groundhog guru, is said to have a team of groundhog psychologists, weather experts, and a life coach named Gary, who specializes in motivating rodents. Phil's preparation involves hours of burrow meditation, sunbathing and a healthy dose of \"Groundhog Day\" reruns because nothing says \"preparation\" like Bill Murray's comedic time-loop shenanigans.</p>\n<p>In the days leading up to the grand prediction, Punxsutawney transforms into a Groundhog Day carnival. Street vendors peddle an array of \"Phil-tastic\" merchandise, from groundhog-shaped umbrellas to limited-edition shadow-themed sunglasses. The local diner even serves up a special dish called \"Six More Weeks of Winter Waffles,\" topped with an avalanche of whipped cream.</p>\n<p>Enter Gary, a rival groundhog attempting to cast a shadow over Phil's predictions by spreading rumors about his burrow antics. Gary claims Phil spends his winters binge-watching groundhog soap operas and refining his dance moves for an imaginary \"Groundhog's Got Talent.\"</p>\n<p>As the fateful morning arrives, the town is alive with excitement and anxiety. Will Phil cast a shadow, dooming us to endure six more weeks of winter? Or will he predict an early spring, giving us hope for flip-flop weather sooner rather than later?</p>\n<p>In a surprising twist, Phil announces, \"I've decided to take a gap year from weather predictions. Comedy is my calling!\" The crowd is left in stunned silence, unsure if Phil's announcement is part of a grand Groundhog conspiracy or just a mid-life crisis.</p>\n<p>Seizing the opportunity, Gary steps into the limelight, declaring himself the new weather prophet. Emerging from his burrow wearing a cape made of recycled weather reports, Gary confidently claims, \"I spotted my shadow and a shooting star — brace yourselves for six weeks of meteor showers, folks!\"</p>\n<p>And so, the chaos unfolds in Punxsutawney as residents grapple with the uncertainty of their weather future. One thing is certain — whether it is six more weeks of winter or an impending groundhog uprising, Punxsutawney Groundhog Day will always be a legendary blend of laughter, absurdity and a touch of weather whimsy.</p>",

The obvious answers might be the anxiety about getting a job, the fear of rejection, the fact that your interviews always align with finals or realizing you were broke after engaging in some retail therapy. But all of those answers are wrong. The actual reason why co-op application season is so stressful is the co-op portal. A portal that looks so old that it will probably be running for president in 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drexel’s pride and joy is co-op, so tell me why it feels like I am Sisyphus pushing his rock uphill whenever I use the portal. If you want to know where Drexel’s priorities lie, look no further than the payment portal. A portal so clean and slick that it would make the TikTok girlies jealous. It's clear who the favorite child is, and it is not the one they brag about to all the relatives at Thanksgiving. It's simple really: we use the pretty payment portal, Drexel gets our money, and they spend it on [checks notes] a SEPTA station. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The craziest part about this is the fact we have an entire major dedicated to user experience and interaction design. Why can’t we use one of them to fix our co-op portal? It could be their senior project, or better yet, make it a co-op. It would be a mini pyramid scheme: Drexel hires a student for a co-op to help other kids get a co-op.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can't imagine what employers think when they see how antiquated the interface looks. “This is Drexel’s portal?

            "body_html": "<p>eRay Ban and Meta announced a partnership last year to sell high quality smart glasses. The glasses include two cameras and allow the user to record videos and take pictures discreetly. This idea is a &nbsp;nightmarish development in the expanding invasion of privacy that is quickly taking over our lives. As TikTok has become more popular the quest for likes has resulted in people recording every simple interaction they can in the hopes of getting that sweet validation so many desperately crave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of living in the moment and enjoying the goofy company of close friends, every word or action now needs to be carefully self-monitored to prevent yourself from becoming a viral laughingstock. Every mistake a person makes, joke a person tells, or awkward moment someone has is now at risk of being blasted over the internet for millions to see. The mistakes of our past are doomed to haunt us as self-righteous observers pick up their pitchforks to attack those they deem immoral after watching a 30 second TikTok video. Just as frustrating are the secret recordings of people who do not realize they are being made fun of for the entertainment of strangers.</p>\n<p>It is a universal truth that everyone has said something they wish they didn’t say or done something they wish they did not do. In the past, these moments could be easily forgotten. Now, it seems as though even the most mundane activities need to be choreographed and filmed like we are all actors in an episode of \"Girls\" The ability to create narratives from short clips has allowed people to villainize others they don’t like. One famous example of this is the video recording of Douglas Levison yelling at a trumpet player in New York City. Levison has said in interviews after the incident that he was frustrated with the noisy trumpet player for almost hitting him with his bike. Levison’s reaction was certainly overkill, but the mountain of insults calling him ugly, short and a goblin were equally uncalled for because no one knew what happened before the camera was recording. Levison went on to lampoon himself in the film Heaven Knows What, demonstrating he at least has a sense of humor about the incident.</p>\n<p>In some cases, recording people is no doubt a good thing. During the 2020 murder of George Floyd a cell phone recording provided the critical evidence needed to convict police officer Derek Chauvin and send him to prison. This is one of the greatest examples of when recording something yields positive results – in this case, the conviction of a murderer. Technological advancements, including more abundant cameras, do have the potential to improve our lives when it comes to crime prevention. Video evidence can assist in proving or disproving guilt in the case of serious crimes. That being said, convicting someone who committed a crime is very different from recording your wannabe comedian friend doing an insensitive standup routine. Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and others are now holding piles of dirt on people that have in many cases been used to destroy the lives of good people. The same people who cast the heaviest judgment upon those who they deem immoral or wrong are in reality just waiting their turn to sit in the same exact hot seat. We have all gotten upset at someone and overreacted or said something awkward. That is why there are so many memes that literally joke about this very fact.</p>\n<p>Think before you pull out your phone. Ask yourself this important question, “will anyone care about this as much as I do?” If the answer is not an enthusiastic “yes” then do yourself and others a favor. Stop recording every moment you have and posting it on the internet. You may not realize it now, but we do not yet live in a world that forgives the common mistakes of people. Save the camera for truly important moments because we live in a world that is constantly looking for the next person to hate and using social media to find them. This reality is unfortunately very dangerous for our futures.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Every year, billions of people commit themselves to New Year’s Resolutions. With the new year came a new slate for Drexel’s Basketball teams, and I took the responsibility upon myself to make some of the Dragons’ lives easier by coming up with their resolutions for them.</p>\n<p><b>Mate Okros: Make some history</b></p>\n<p>When I sat down to interview Coach Zack Spiker right before the basketball season began, he told me that Mate Okros would be in the opening night starting five. This took me by surprise because Okros, while a talented player, has had multiple chances at being a starter without much success in that role. Spiker explained this decision with a bold proclamation: that Okros would enter Drexel Men’s Basketball top 10 in career 3-point baskets made. Entering the season, Okros needed 47 made 3’s to crack the top 10. For the first ten games of the season, Okros only made six three-pointers on just 18 attempts. In the last eight games, however, Okros has made 18 threes on 37 attempts. Unsurprisingly, in those past eight games, the Dragons have seven wins. If Okros keeps shooting the ball, he can help lead the Dragons to postseason success while collecting individual accomplishments.</p>\n<p><b>Yame Butler: Get back in a groove</b></p>\n<p>It would not be hyperbolic to say the Yame Butler single handedly saved the 2022-2023 Drexel Basketball season. Butler dazzled the DAC with his tight handles and knack for getting to the rim and finishing through anyone in his way. Part of his skillset was also his shooting. Last season, Butler shot 45% from three-point range, and 87% from the free throw line. This season, however, Butler is shooting just 22% from deep and 68% from the charity stripe. Butler is one of a select few Dragons who can create his own shot through his dribbling ability and athleticism, and there's no stopping this offense if Butler can return to the form he has proven capable of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amari Williams: Play 30 minutes</b></p>\n<p>Amari Williams is the best player on the Dragons roster and can be the best player in the CAA if he wants to be. If you were to look at Amari’s statistics, however, you might think he is underperforming. As a wildly athletic, nearly seven-foot center, Williams probably should be averaging more than 12 points and 8 rebounds per game. However, when you consider the fact that Williams’ season high in minutes is 32, and he averages just 21 minutes, those statistics jump off the page a whole lot more. Williams’ health has to be preserved, and there is no sense in subjecting your star center to needless abuse in games that are not close. However, with important postseason games on the horizon, it is entirely likely that the Dragons will need Williams to stay on the court for over 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><b>Chloe Hodges: Get a double-double</b></p>\n<p>After averaging five points-per-game last season, Hodges has cemented herself as a crucial player for the Dragons. The Senior forward has had some explosive offensive performances, most notably her 21 point showing against Northeastern earlier in January. However, as one of the few players above 6 feet tall on Drexel Women's Basketball team, Hodges also has an important role as a rebounder. She is the team’s leader in collected boards, and she has amassed seven rebounds on five separate occasions. While Amaris Baker recently collected the team’s first double-double of the season, it is Hodges who most frequently flirts with that impressive statline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Grace O'Neill: Level up</b></p>\n<p>In her freshman season, O’Neill turned heads as a jack-of-all-trades point guard who chipped in on every single column of the stat sheet. While this is still true in her sophomore year, O’Neill is averaging less points, steals and rebounds, all while shooting at a significantly less efficient clip. The Dragons are a formidable team and O’Neill is a big part of that, but if they hope to make some noise in 2024, she will have to not only regain her previous level, but raise it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Amy Mallon: Find some more points</b></p>\n<p>While Mallon has put in a terrific effort to get her roster playing as well as she has, one area that can improve is the offense. While the Dragons have still scored more points than they’ve let up, their offense is far from lethal. As a team, the Dragons have shot just over 40% from the field and 30% from deep. In the CAA, Drexel is 11th out of the 14 schools in average points per game. One change could lie in freshman Laine McGurk who is 8th in minutes played yet 4th in points-per-game.</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Despite it being nearly five years since 21 Savage released his last solo album, he has never strayed far from the spotlight in that time. This could be a result of the ridiculous feature run he has been on the last few years on what feels like every album that comes out. Or it could be because of his massively successful collaborative albums, such as 2020’s \"Savage Mode 2\" with producer Metro Boomin’, or 2022’s \"Her Loss,\" a partnership with Drake. It could also be because of what 21 gets up to outside of music, most notably his 2019 arrest, due to the fact that he was essentially an illegal immigrant, having moved to the United States from England nearly 20 years ago while having no documentation for a majority of that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This whole situation was seemingly the inspiration for his new album, titled \"American Dream.\" For the first time since 2018, 21 is back in the saddle, and throughout the album, it is clear that 21 and only 21 was in control of the creative choices. Sometimes this leads to moments that although unexpected, definitely work, and are worth the risk. However, these chances often fall flat, resulting in songs that are not necessarily bad, but just not what anyone wants to hear from 21.</p>\n<p>The album begins with a spoken-word intro from 21 Savage’s mother, with her discussing the risks they took that allowed 21 to be who he is, presumably referring to their decision to immigrate to the U.S., or even to the struggles that they faced well after moving. In the next song, titled “All of Me,” 21 dives right into those struggles in traditional 21 fashion, giving an extremely detailed look into what he’s been through, which, according to him involved a lot of violence, murder and loss. The next song, “redrum” (\"murder\" backward), sees 21 go even further into these topics. On the hook, Savage continuously repeats the line “G block, all we know is redrum,” implying that where he grew up, murder and violence were normal, if not necessary in order to make it out, a stark contrast to the idea of the American dream.</p>\n<p>Savage switches up his energy on the next few songs, starting with “n.h.i.e.,” with an unexpected feature from Doja Cat. Although he sings about similar subject matter to the last few songs, sonically this is a different 21 Savage than ever before, giving his most melodic performance to date, and a beautiful one at that. This song is one of the album's many highlights and an example of what 21 is capable of when he goes out of his comfort zone. He takes a similar R&amp;B route on a three-track run later in the album with the songs “see the real,” “prove it” and “should’ve worn a bonnet,” with the latter two featuring Summer Walker and Brent Faiyaz, respectively. These songs and others scattered throughout the album also see 21 in his melodic bag, a side of him that certainly needs to come out more often.</p>\n<p>Other gems include the handful of Metro-produced songs, and despite how great 21 has sounded on other types of instrumentals, this is his bread and butter, and 21 at his very best. In the modern rap landscape, it is hard to find someone better than 21 on a Metro beat. The chemistry between the two is just too strong, and when they work together they are able to create a sound that just cannot be replicated, no matter how hard someone may try. Examples on the album include the songs “nee-nah” with Travis Scott and “pop ur shit” with Young Thug.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite how far all of the artists have come in their careers and all their success, the Atlanta trap songs are the ones that made them who they are, and on these songs, it is very clear that they have not lost a step. The standout track on the album, however, is the song “letter to my brudda.” Over a relaxed sample-based beat and a piano melody, 21 goes for nearly three minutes straight, mostly discussing his longtime friend and collaborator Young Thug and his current situation. Thug and a collection of his labelmates are involved in an ongoing RICO case, alleging that Thug’s music label is in fact a violent gang. 21 provides his perspective on the situation, and what it is like to watch his friend have his freedom ripped away from him. He also touches on Gunna’s role in the situation, which involved the rapper, a former collaborator of both 21 and Young Thug, seemingly ratting on Thug and his labelmates for his own benefit, something 21 makes clear he disapproves of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the track, 21 lays all his thoughts and emotions out there, not holding a single thing back. In fact, being brutally honest and real is what attracts people to 21 and his music. He doesn’t sugarcoat anything, which may be gruesome at times, but at the end of the day, it allows him to paint a picture that not many others can replicate. So even though the style of his music may change a little bit, the sincerity of his music has never faltered, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to anytime soon.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>",
